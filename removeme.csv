UFOs, commonly known as UFOs, have come and gone without a trace in the sky from science fiction movies and TV shows. They have brought everyone surprise, romance and entertainment for decades, and of course they may have brought a little worry to some people. Even fear. There is not much cooperation between the two parties in the U.S. Congress, but they share the same interest in UFOs. In December last year, they ordered the Department of Defense to submit a research report within six months. Especially in recent years, they have often encountered aircraft on the East Coast and were filmed by the pilots. , what exactly is the amazing flash? So a formal task force, UAPTF (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force), was established to study unexplained aerial phenomena. This is not the first time that the government has stepped forward to study UFOs. As early as the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force had a Blue Book project to collect reports of UFO incidents from all over the country. Over the past ten years, there have been more than 10,000 incidents, which were later made into a popular TV series. . From 1966 to 1968, the Air Force and University of Colorado physicist Edward Condon formed a committee to investigate the contents of the Blue Book and concluded that the scientific value was not high. In addition to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and France also have governments involved in UFO investigations. Congress came forward to investigate UFOs and raised concerns about national security, lest this advanced technology come from "other countries" and pose a threat to the military power of the United States. It is because of this increase in political power that everyone is interested in the upcoming report. and attention, hoping to unravel some previously unknown mysteries. Nowadays, most of what you see are those videos on the Internet, in which a fighter jet locks onto a black shadow that jumps around, or the radar screen shows seven or eight shadows constantly shaking around a ship. The Ministry of National Defense must have more " Evidence", which we hope will be declassified in this official report. The New York Times at the beginning of the month, as well as insider sources, roughly disclosed the content of this report, saying that there was no evidence that UFOs had contact with extraterrestrials to prove that they were not from this earth, but their rapid movement confused a lot of people. Science and military experts still cannot explain it. In addition, the analysis of 120 incidents in 20 years has not found the involvement of the US military or US technology, which eliminates the possibility of US secret weapons. This is the only conclusion found from the encrypted files. Of course, this conclusion will disappoint UFO fans. Since UFO research has been pushed to such a high level by political forces, on the eve of the "declassification", in addition to the media becoming active, some scientists also\nDocument [2]: The first UFO sighting in Iowa in 1947 is no longer a joke. The CBS program "60 Minutes" interviewed a former naval officer who witnessed a UFO and took a video. (Getty Images) "UFOs", commonly known as "UFOs" (Unidentified flying objects), have long been ignored by politicians and the media, or even treated as a joke; but now, from former government officials to mainstream media, UFOs It is no longer a joke and is gradually becoming an issue worth discussing. The New York Times reported that the recognized "modern" UFO sighting occurred on June 24, 1947, when an Idaho pilot, Kenneth Arnold, reported seeing a sighting on Mount Rainier in Washington State. Nine round objects flew at supersonic speeds, and the name "flying saucer" spread like wildfire. The report pointed out that it must be clarified that "UFOs" are not directly related to so-called "alien"; the government at the time did not necessarily fully trust Arnold's sighting, but it still launched the "Project Sign" secret for this purpose. project, the reason being concerns that it might be an advanced Soviet weapon. The blue book of the project released in the 1970s showed that the government investigated about 12,000 UFO sightings between 1952 and 1969, of which 701 were "unexplained"; since then, UFOs have no longer been something the government will take seriously. One of the topics discussed, at least judging from the information that has been made public so far. This situation changed in 2007. At the request of U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Department of Defense received $22 million in funding to launch a classified project called the "Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program" (AATIP); The project was not revealed until 2017. The actions of the Ministry of National Defense are not over. Last year, the "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force" (UAPTF) project was established to replace it. This team aims to "investigate, analyze, and file UFOs that may threaten national security" and try to eliminate the "unidentified aerial phenomena task force" (UAPTF) that the outside world regards as a joke. " atmosphere to encourage people to "say what they see." Under the requirements of last year's $2.3 trillion bailout bill, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence must declassify the government's current known information on UFOs by the end of this month. This is one of the reasons why mainstream media have recently increased discussion of this issue. Many former government officials have recently begun to talk about UFO issues in mainstream media. Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said on Fox News in March that there were "much more sightings than what has been made public." And many of the events are "difficult to explain"; former President Obama said on a CBS talk show that there are objects in the sky that "we don't know exactly what they are." Data compiled by the non-governmental organization "National UFO Reporting Center" (NUFORC) show that last year there were 15% more UFO sightings than in 2019, reaching 7,200; however, the center stated that "as in previous years," almost all\nDocument [3]: "Shadow" is rapidly approaching! A direct look at the mysterious UFO chasing the passenger plane in the United States March 22, 2018 10:37 China Times Electronic News Cai Xuan Since the Pentagon admitted last year that it has spent US$22 million (approximately NT$700 million) every year to implement the "Advanced Flight" After the "Threat Identification Project" studied unidentified flying objects (UFOs), multiple videos of the U.S. military encountering UFOs were released one after another. Recently, some netizens took a video of a suspected UFO chasing a jetliner at high speed in the United States, and immediately chased it to the passenger plane. Not only did the netizens who took the video were stunned, but it also sparked a heated discussion on the Internet. According to the British "Sun" report, this video was shot in 2016 in New Hampshire, USA. The filmmaker was recently interviewed and said that there are often military aircraft training near his home, so seeing fighter planes and helicopters flying across the sky is no longer enough. Strange. But on the day the video was taken, he saw a jetliner flying by. He looked a few times and noticed something was following the plane. The photographer initially thought the UFO was a new military aircraft, but later he discovered something was wrong with the pointed and flat flying object. The UFO caught up with the passenger plane at high speed. He also said that shortly after the UFO passed the passenger plane, three other planes and a helicopter also flew towards the direction where the UFO left. This video has also caused a sensation on the Internet. Although there has been no explanation so far, many people believe that this is evidence that relevant units are studying UFOs. Some netizens believe that "the two flying objects were at different heights and left behind Different trajectories." Some netizens said they were "excited and anxious" after watching this video.

The U.S. Aviation Administration released audio files exposing two pilots' direct encounters with UFOs March 29, 2018 17:27 China Times Electronic News Cai Xuan Since the Pentagon admitted last year that it spent US$22 million (approximately NT$700 million) every year ) implemented the "Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program" to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and videos of U.S. military fighter jets encountering UFOs in the air have been released one after another. Recently, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also released an audio file, revealing that two commercial airliners also passed by UFOs in the sky. According to the Washington Post, when a Phoenix Air flight was flying at an altitude of 37,000 feet on February 24, the captain asked the Albuquerque Center Air Traffic Control, "Is there any "The flying object passed by me 30 seconds ago?", the air traffic control center immediately replied no, but the captain said after a few seconds, "Okay, something did pass by." Then someone said, "It was a UFO." The captain also said, "Yes." ah". Coincidentally, less than a minute after this strange incident occurred, an American Airlines flight about 40,000 feet above the Sonoran Desert also reported that a UFO had collided with the plane. It passed by, but the aviation administration said there were no other planes nearby. The captain of American Airlines said that something did fly from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the plane he was flying. It did not seem to be a Google Balloon, and the unknown flying object had a large amount of reflection while flying in the sky. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a statement stating that it is currently unable to determine what the unidentified flying object is. However, the FAA also stated that it has established close ties with multiple agencies for a long time and can fully understand all passenger and military aircraft that appear in the sky. As well as all types of known aircraft, including high-altitude weather balloons.

Documents confirm that the U.S. Department of Defense has invested in research on invisibility cloaks, wormholes, and warp engines. Related documents show that the U.S. Department of Defense has conducted research on invisibility cloaks, wormholes, and warp engines. It also conducts research on the application of technologies such as warp engines, and also confirms that the United States has continued to invest in UFO investigations in the past. Share facebook Although invisibility cloaks, wormholes, and warp drives often appear in science fiction movies or novels, it is obvious that the U.S. Department of Defense does intend to make such technologies a reality. A document released based on a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request confirmed that the U.S. Department of Defense has indeed invested in a lot of black technology research and development, including how to use optical technology to achieve stealth effects. It has also indeed invested in research on wormholes and warp speed. Engine design, but found that the technology at this stage is still unable to achieve it. As for the black technologies invested by the U.S. Department of Defense, some have been confirmed to be unfeasible and have been terminated. However, some technologies, such as wormhole applications, are still being invested in development. There may be opportunities to realize related technologies in the future. In addition, documents also show that the Defense Intelligence Agency, a subsidiary of the U.S. Department of Defense, spent US$22 million on the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP) from 2007 to 2012, which is also investment in UFO investigation and research. In the past, the U.S. authorities have always denied investing in UFO investigations, but subsequent declassifications finally confirmed that they had indeed invested in research into such incidents in the past.

Reports of such phenomena have attracted increasing attention from U.S. officials and lawmakers in recent years. They worry that this may pose a national security concern. Last year, the Department of Defense released three videos of Navy personnel witnessing UAPs, which aroused widespread response. The Senate Intelligence Committee asked the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies to provide analysis of related incidents. The Ministry of National Defense established a working group in August to study such incidents. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 was also included in the epidemic relief bill last December, ordering government agencies to provide declassified analysis of UAP data and intelligence. He said there were no signs of extraterrestrial involvement but did not rule out the possibility. The report was prepared by a working group of the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Most of the 144 reports received by the authorities were filed in the past two years, that is, after the Navy established a standardized reporting mechanism. Since this mechanism was only established the year before last, limited data and inconsistent reporting have made investigations difficult. Some incidents may be due to technical problems such as sensor failure, but 80 of them involve the observation of several sensors, and it is believed that they may be actual objects. The report "highly believes" that one of the UAP cases involved a large deflated balloon, but the remaining 143 cases could not be explained. Although there is no clear indication that it is related to extraterrestrials, the possibility cannot be ruled out. The report mentioned 18 incidents in which military aircraft personnel reported unusual movement patterns or flight characteristics of flying objects, such as appearing stationary in the wind, moving against the wind, or moving suddenly or rapidly. In a few cases, military aircraft systems have detected radio frequency energy associated with UAPs. The working group will conduct further analysis on such cases. The report lists 5 possible causes of natural phenomena such as airborne debris. Investigators believe that these phenomena may not have a single explanation and divide the possible causes into 5 categories. The first is interference from airborne debris, such as balloons, recreational drones and even plastic bags. , or affect the ability of military aircraft personnel to identify targets. The second category is natural atmospheric phenomena. Some infrared and radar systems may display phenomena such as ice crystals, moisture or thermal fluctuations as flying objects. The third category is research and development projects by U.S. government agencies or industry. However, officials who were briefed on the report earlier believe that these flying objects are not U.S. technology. The fourth category is technology designed by foreign adversaries or non-governmental entities such as China and Russia. China and Russia have made progress in hypersonic technology and missile energy in recent years, and these areas have also attracted increasing attention\nDocument [9]: U.S. experts exploded that "Taiwanese fishing boats caught UFOs"! U.S. warships received a list of top secret Internet searches in one second/comprehensive report. Steven Greer, a well-known U.S. UFO expert, shocked the media when he was interviewed by the media in December last year. A fishing boat once picked up an "unidentified flying object" with a diameter of about 6 to 9 meters in the waters near Guam, but the US Coast Guard immediately rushed to receive it after hearing the news, and classified the matter as a top secret of the US government. Greer, the founder of the Center for Research on Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), recently appeared on RT America in an interview with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, saying that the U.S. government has been concealing aliens for many years. He had visited the Earth. In order to reveal the truth, he had been traveling around investigating government and military files. Unexpectedly, he recently received a tip from a military informant that there were frequent activities of extraterrestrial aircraft in the Mariana Trench in the southwest, and even A Taiwanese fishing boat accidentally salvaged an aircraft. ▲Greer broke the news that a Taiwanese fishing boat captured a UFO, but a U.S. warship came to take it away. (Photo/Dongsen News) Greer said that at that time, a Taiwanese fishing boat was fishing near the Mariana Trench and accidentally caught a dish-shaped object with a diameter of 20 feet to 30 feet (about 6.1 meters to 9.14 meters) in a fishing net. Thinking of the U.S. patrol ship coming upon hearing the news, it asked for "recovery" on the spot, and the aircraft was immediately fished out of the water and onto the ship. However, the weight was so heavy that it once caused the hull to tilt 45 degrees. Greer did not disclose the exact date of the incident. "This incident only came to light in the past one or two months, and we are collecting relevant information." However, he emphasized that the news came from the US military stationed in Guam, and that this incident The incident has been classified as top secret by the US government. ▲Greer said that the information came from a "witness" who served in the US military. (Photo/reproduced from Twitter/@GovJVentura) Greer broke the news that the U.S. military’s underwater search for UFOs has been secretly carried out for decades. Not only does it invest an extremely staggering research budget every year, but the relevant personnel are forced to sign long-term 70-year confidentiality agreement. Although Greer has made many accusations, there is still a lack of conclusive witness and material evidence. Whether these inside stories are true or false remains to be verified by all walks of life. However, what is certain is that humans have a strong interest in the visit of extraterrestrial life. Until the truth is revealed, these mysterious rumors of UFOs and UFOs will continue.\nDocument [10]: UFO details declassified, US intelligence agencies have 180 days to explain - Political Circle: UFO (UFO) video released by the Pentagon In December last year, US President Trump linked the COVID-19 pandemic with government funds worth US$2.3 trillion (approximately NT$64 trillion). The bill was signed into law and the 180-day countdown began. Within this deadline, intelligence agencies must report to Congress everything they know about UFOs. According to a CNN News report on the 10th, U.S. intelligence agencies and the Pentagon now have less than six months to provide declassified reports on unidentified aerial phenomena. And this provision of the Intelligence Authorization Act 2021 (IAA) is included in the huge expenditure package. According to the instructions of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the report must provide a detailed analysis of the Office of Naval Intelligence (Office of Naval Intelligence), the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and the FBI (FBI).

For what? Image copyright Getty Images The US Department of Defense has spent millions of dollars researching unidentified flying objects. Among other things, as part of the initiative, the Pentagon collected photographs and videos of objects floating in the air or moving at unusually high speeds, American media reported. The project, called the “Advanced Aerospace Threat Recognition Program,” was launched in 2007 and, according to American media, was discontinued in 2012. Its idea belonged to the then leader of the Democratic majority in the US Senate, Harry Reid. "I don't feel embarrassed or ashamed or sorry that I started this thing. I did something that no one has done before," Reed told the New York Times. The program cost the US Department of Defense more than $20 million (1.2 billion rubles at the current exchange rate). It was closed in order to save budget money. The program could be used to study the technological developments of rival countries of the United States, a former congressional staffer told Politico. “Or maybe China or Russia are trying to do something or are using a propulsion system that we don’t know about?” - says the source of the publication. This year, the US Central Intelligence Agency has posted millions of pages of declassified documents online. Among other things, they contain references to UFOs, as well as reports of sightings of flying saucers.\nDocument [2]: Unidentified phenomena experts: why the Pentagon created a special group to study UFOs The Pentagon has created a working group that will investigate cases of “unidentified aerial phenomena.” The department said in a statement that the new Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force will be tasked with “detecting, analyzing” and listing UFOs that could potentially threaten U.S. national security. Earlier, the US Department of Defense published videos that allegedly showed unknown aircraft. However, experts believe that by drawing attention to the topic of UFOs, the Pentagon is trying to identify a new reason for receiving additional funding. The Pentagon has created a special task force that will investigate and study “unidentified aerial phenomena” or unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This is stated in the official message posted on the website of the American military department. “The U.S. Department of Defense established the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to better understand and gain insight into the nature and origins of unidentified aerial phenomena. The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog unidentified aerial phenomena that may pose a threat to US national security,” the defense department noted. The statement said the group was created by order of Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist on August 4. It will work under the auspices of the US Department of the Navy and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security. “The U.S. Department of Defense and military agencies take any incursions by unidentified aircraft into training ranges or designated airspace very seriously and conduct investigations after each incident. These include checking for intrusions that were initially recorded as unidentified aerial phenomena, where the observer is unable to immediately determine what exactly he or she is seeing,” the report explains. Return of UFOs The topic of UFOs was again raised in the American media in December 2017. Then a number of publications, including The New York Times, Politico, Time, Newsweek, reported on the Pentagon program, which, among other things, was studying UFOs. Video materials were also widely circulated in which one could see the pursuit of allegedly unidentified aircraft by US Navy pilots. The US military department then confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which existed from 2007 to 2012. According to media reports, $22 million was spent on the study of unidentified flying objects and unidentified atmospheric phenomena. Photo of an unidentified flying object in New Mexico Gettyimages.ru © Bettmann In 2019, new details about this program appeared in the American media, and the military the pilots confirmed their participation in the events described. Media interest in the UFO topic has increased so much that journalists turned directly to Donald Trump for clarification. In response to a question about the increasing number of reports by US Navy pilots of encounters with unidentified flying objects, the President said that he had been informed of alleged UFO sightings. “I have seen materials, read and heard about it. I even had one very short meeting on this issue. People claim to see UFOs.

At the same time, TTSA gained fame in 2017 as an organization engaged in UFO research. Experts believe that the US military has found a new item for spending the military budget and a new legend to cover up the development of secret weapons. The U.S. Army Combat Capability Development Command's Ground Transportation Systems Development Center has confirmed that it is participating in a joint research project with the To The Stars Academy (TTSA), which the American media characterizes as an organization dedicated to studying UFOs and unidentified atmospheric phenomena. At the same time, it was representatives of the United States Army who initiated the joint project. According to a contract signed between TTSA and the research center in October, the US military is interested in research, particularly in such exotic areas as active optical camouflage, reduction of inertial mass of objects and communications based on the principles of quantum physics. Also on the topic Friends from Vegas: where did they spend the millions of dollars allocated by the Pentagon “to study UFOs?” The Pentagon confirmed the existence of a program, one of the main goals of which was to collect information about UFOs. According to American... In addition, the government is showing interest in a project by To The Stars called ADAM, whose task is to collect and analyze data on metamaterials. Douglas Hallow, a spokesman for the US Army Combat Development Command's Ground Transportation Systems Development Center, called it "a global network for the collection and study of new materials." It is worth noting that, according to TTSA, some of these new exotic metamaterials were allegedly obtained by company specialists during the study of various unidentified flying objects - this is a hint of their extraterrestrial origin. However, representatives of the United States Army are not embarrassed by such TTSA statements. “If the materials studied as part of the ADAM project pass scientific examination and TTSA can justify the feasibility of their use for military purposes, it would make sense to study them in more detail,” Vice quoted Hallow as saying. The Army Research Center spokesman added that U.S. officials believe that "the critical technologies or capabilities that the Army is exploring in collaboration with the company are clearly on the edge of what is achievable," but that the research does not involve significant costs. A new word in ufology The To The Stars Academy organization first came to the attention of the American media in 2017. Founded by former lead singer of the popular rock band Blink-182 Tom DeLonge, TTSA promised to become the leading ufological organization and at the same time a mediator between American government sources and citizens who want to know the truth about the UFO phenomenon. In December 2017, the organization provided leading American newspapers with a video showing a\nDocument [4]: The New York Times: First on the Pentagon's mysterious UFO program WASHINGTON - In the Pentagon's $600 billion budget, it's nearly impossible to find the unimpressive $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threats Program. This is exactly the kind of secrecy that the Ministry of Defense needed. Over the years, the program has studied reports of unidentified flying objects, as evidenced by statements from Pentagon officials, interviews with program participants, and documents obtained by The New York Times. The program was led by military intelligence officer Luis Elizondo, and its participants' offices were located on the fifth floor of Ring C, deep in the Pentagon labyrinth. The Defense Department has never previously acknowledged the existence of such a program, saying it was closed in 2012. But its supporters say that although the Pentagon stopped funding it at the time, the program continues to operate. According to them, for the past five years, participants in this program have continued to study all the cases that military personnel report to them. In parallel, they perform other official duties in the Ministry of Defense. The mysterious program, which is still hidden under a veil of secrecy, was started in 2007. It was initially funded at the request of Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, who was the Senate Majority Leader at the time. This person has been interested in this phenomenon for a long time. Much of the money went to an aerospace research company run by billionaire entrepreneur and Reed's longtime friend Robert Bigelow, who is currently working with NASA to develop a self-deploying spacecraft that humans could use in space. Speaking on "60 Minutes" in May, Bigelow said he was "absolutely convinced" that aliens exist and that UFOs are coming to Earth. Working with the Bigelow Company, which is headquartered in Las Vegas, the program participants have prepared a series of documents that describe cases of detection of aircraft moving at high speeds without visible signs of propulsion systems, and also hovering in the air as if they were not flying. the force of gravity acts. Program participants also studied video recordings of encounters between unidentified objects and American military aircraft. One of these entries appeared in August. It shows two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets from the USS Nimitz pursuing an oval, whitish-colored object the size of an airliner. This happened near the coast near the city of San Diego in 2004. Reed, who retired from Congress this year, said he was proud of the program. "I'm not ashamed or sorry that I started it," Reed said in a recent interview in Nevada. “I think this is one of the good things I did while serving in Congress.” I did something that no one had done before.” The program was supported by two other former senators and ranking members of the defense spending subcommittee. These are Alaska Republican Ted Stevens and Hawaii Democrat Daniel K. Inouye. Stevens died in 2010, and Inuye in 2012. MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager says that while we don't know the origins of the unidentified flying objects, that doesn't mean\nDocument [5]: The Pentagon has promised to disclose the collected data on UFOs. The Pentagon's Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force will disclose some of the collected data. This was reported by The New York Times with reference to the report of the US Senate Intelligence Committee. Article continues below advertisement Advertisement According to the document, the group must “standardize data and reports” on sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and report at least some of its findings to the public within six months of intelligence clearance, RBC reports. The group was created in 2017. It was preceded by another program, the Enhanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which was officially completed in 2012. However, people who worked in it claimed that the program continued to function after its closure. The Ministry of Defense later confirmed this, NYT reports. According to program employee Eric Davis, who has worked in it since 2007, in some cases the examination could not determine the source of the objects found. This led him to conclude that they were of extraterrestrial origin. Davis also said he held a closed briefing for the Ministry of Defense on the search for "out-of-this-world vehicles that were not made on Earth." Senate Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said earlier this week that he was concerned about flying objects appearing over US military bases and military training sites, but attributed his concerns to political reasons. “Frankly, if it came from somewhere outside of this planet, it would be better than if it was some technological leap from China or Russia or some other adversary,” the senator said. He noted that this is one of the threats to US national security and this must be taken into account. In mid-June, President Donald Trump said he would consider declassifying documents related to one of the incidents associated with UFOs. It happened in 1947 on a ranch in New Mexico, when the owner discovered the wreckage of an unknown object. Authorities said it was a weather balloon, but after the incident, UFO theories began to spread.\nDocument [6]: The Pentagon has created a working group that will study unidentified flying objects. Detect, analyze and compile a list of UFOs that could potentially threaten the security of the country. This is the mission of a special working group at the US Department of Defense, according to the military department’s website. The Pentagon wants to better understand the nature and origin of unidentified flying objects. In April, the ministry published videos in which objects were removed from military aircraft that did not look like any known aircraft. One, as the New York Times wrote with reference to the pilots, was in the shape of a top that moved against the wind, the other was in the shape of a sphere enclosed in a cube. Americans, but not only them, have long been concerned about the topic of unidentified flying objects. President Trump in June promised to consider declassifying documents about the alleged UFO crash in New Mexico in 1947. Western media reported several years ago about the US government program for the study of UFOs; its budget was estimated at more than $20 million. Within this framework, a working group emerged. The Pentagon plans to release part of the collected data on UFOs within six months.\nDocument [7]: The Pentagon has promised to disclose the collected data on UFOs.

The military and officials were concerned about this trend and launched another project to study atmospheric phenomena. Lenta.ru talks about whether he will repeat the mistakes of the recently closed AATIP program, on which the Pentagon spent tens of millions of dollars. New Blue Book New US Navy policy requires pilots and personnel to report any sightings of unexplained atmospheric phenomena. The decision to pay more attention to aerial phenomena came after an increase in the number of military pilots reporting UFOs and unidentified vehicles over the country. A special reporting form was developed that would allow the observations to be systematized and each case to be investigated. Instead of the abbreviation UFO (UFO), another abbreviation will be used in the documents, UFO or “unexplained aerial phenomenon” (UAP). Between 2014 and 2015, pilots reported new sightings of strange phenomena during training flights along the southeast coast of the United States. On-board equipment, including cameras and radars, recorded objects that were moving at hypersonic speeds at altitudes of up to nine thousand meters. At the same time, there were no signs of the operation of jet engines, such as exhaust strips. According to one of the pilots, none of the objects had wings or a tail. At the same time, the UFOs behaved as if they were controlled by someone. They circled the planes and looked like a small white spot and a large dark ball. They later received the nicknames "Go Fast" and "Gimbal". The pilots were surprised that the presence of objects was recorded not by one sensor, which could be mistaken for a device failure, but by several at once. However, they did not seriously consider the possibility that these could be alien ships. According to the pilots, the strange phenomenon could be part of a secret program to develop drones based on unknown technologies. They are also concerned that UFOs, based on their “behavior,” may pose a threat to their comrades and national security. It was the latter circumstance that forced officials to again seriously think about the problem of anomalous air phenomena. Messages from pilots who encounter the unexplained will be classified and not available to the general public. Past mistakes Lenta.ru has already written that until 2012, the Pentagon supported the AATIP (The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program) program for identifying advanced aviation threats, within the framework of which, in particular, UFO incidents were studied. The program's leaders allegedly stated that they had evidence of the existence of aliens. Until 2011, AATIP was headed by Luis Elizondo. And, as his recent interview with The New York Times revealed, the project did not actually identify UFOs with aliens. Elizondo left because the alarming conclusions reached by AATIP experts were ignored, and no one wanted to take into account the potential risks from UFOs. Elizondo hopes that the issue of unexplained aerial phenomena, which can pose a significant threat, will begin to be openly discussed and the numerous witnesses will\nDocument [9]: The US Congress requires the military to provide reports on UFOs. The Department of Defense intends to compile a catalog of unidentified flying objects. Washington. USA. The Pentagon is being asked to report on UFO reports. As Gazeta.ru writes, the US Department of Defense will study how the military processed information about unidentified flying objects. The order is posted on the Pentagon website. The inspection will be carried out in May-June. It is caused by a Congressional requirement for the US National Intelligence Service and other military agencies to provide “unclassified” reports on UFOs. The US Department of Defense in August 2020 announced the formation of a working group on UFO research. The group will detect and analyze unidentified flying objects that could pose a threat to US national security. The department also intends to maintain a catalog of UFOs.\nDocument [10]: The Pentagon has clear footage of a UFO: insider The US Department of Defense allegedly has videos of an unidentified flying object (UFO). This statement was made by Luis Elizondo, who previously worked in the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Observer reports. According to him, he personally saw footage of a UFO. Allegedly, the American military has a video lasting 23 minutes, Express reports. "The video was extremely compelling - one of many - to the point that I remember having some experience watching it. I sent it to some highly qualified experts in the ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) community. And when it came back to me , in the header of the letter there was a quote without quotation marks, “this is a video of a UFO,” said Luis Elizondo Source: The Sun Elizondo worked at the Pentagon and left in 2017, however, the man refused to disclose additional details, citing his commitment to secrecy and warning. that he could be arrested if he reveals too much. He hopes the footage will be released so that "everyone can see it for themselves." to study unidentified flying objects or unexplained aerial phenomena. The program was first published on December 16, 2017.

However, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, office work and online meetings have become the new normal, and remote business cooperation has become common. This has led to more and more people thinking about entrepreneurial and fundraising bases outside of Silicon Valley. [Texas Science and Technology Innovation Era] This series hopes to start from Austin, the technology center of Texas, and discuss the possibility of Texas becoming the cradle of technological innovation in the future. Finally, I will return to Silicon Valley, California, to try to discuss and understand: Why more and more people say that "Silicon Valley has changed" - has the aura of science and technology innovation on the West Coast of the United States really faded? This article is part of [Texas Science and Technology Innovation Era] articles. Texas Science and Technology Innovation Era Part 1 | Apple and Tesla are stationed in Austin to create a new technology network myth? Along the Gulf Coast of the southern United States, there is a village called Boca Chica. In terms of administrative division, it belongs to Texas. An unincorporated area in Cameron County, Texas. The village of Boca Chica is located in the extreme south of Texas, less than 40 kilometers away from Mexico. It is also one of the southernmost inhabited areas in the United States. Looking back at the local population statistics in 2000, there were only about 20 people living in the village of Boca Chica. But since 2014, Boca Chica Village has never been the same. Less than four kilometers away from it, a rocket launch site, control center and scientific research base with advanced facilities have been set up. These top technological facilities are all owned by the space exploration technology company Space X. ※ The specific location of Boca Chica Village. In March this year, Space ) lives in the area, he pointed out that engineers, technicians, maintenance workers and other employees working at Space X have moved into this area, making it lively. Musk even called this area "Starbase" (tentative translation: "Starbase"). Musk also wrote in another tweet: "In the next year or two, thousands more people will live in Starbase." Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas & encourage friends to do so!

The Optoelectronics Association takes over the Siyuan Science and Creativity Competition. The "Siyuan Science and Creativity University" is specially organized for high school vocational school students. After selecting 50 semi-final teams at the end of June, the finals will be held in late August. This science competition combines resources from industry and academia to organize for young students, encouraging high school workers to apply the principles of physics and chemistry, use their creativity, and take the first step of "applying what they have learned" as early as possible. Due to the epidemic this year, the competition has transformed into a digital one, using online communication and video to allow Taiwanese high school vocational students to successfully participate in the competition and bring glory to their schools. The finals of the Siyuan Science and Creativity Competition are expected to be completed in late August. The gold medal team will receive a scholarship of 100,000 yuan; the two silver medal teams will each receive 50,000 yuan; the three bronze medal teams will each receive 25,000 yuan. The remaining final teams will tie for the top spot and will each receive 2,000 yuan. Multiple honorary awards. The "Siyuan Science and Creativity Competition" was initiated by a group of high school teachers in 2002. It attracts thousands of students to participate in each session and is a nationally renowned extracurricular inter-school competition for high school students. This year, the Siyuan Foundation of Jiaotong University will hand over the competition to the Optoelectronics Association. The 19th competition is sponsored by Synopsys, Jiaotong University Siyuan Foundation, Global Wafer (6488), Wenmao Semiconductor (3105) and other companies, as well as with the assistance of the Jiaotong University Alumni Association, High School Physics Subject Center, High School Chemistry Subject Center, etc. Expand. This year, with the theme of "Optoelectronic Waltz", participating teams are encouraged to use the physical and chemical principles involved in life to be creative and explore how to derive applications in the future. The Optoelectronics Association pointed out that in late June, the review committee selected a total of 50 teams from the North, Central and South districts from 86 preliminary teams to advance to the semi-finals. Contest initiator Shi Jianhui said that science education in Taiwan focuses on memorization and problem solving, and lacks hands-on practice, which is extremely important for learning science. The Siyuan Science and Creativity Competition came into being to encourage students to have the courage to dream and express, and to practice the physical and chemical principles described in textbooks. He believes that after 20 years of competition, there are many surprising creative works. The competition also helps students develop communication, coordination, teamwork and problem-solving skills. Luo Huaijia, CEO of the Optoelectronics Association, pointed out that after taking over the hosting of the Siyuan Science and Creativity Competition, the spirit of training industrial talents will be extended to high school education. For example, the recently released "From Wave Physics to Digital Optics" is to sow the seeds of applied science and technology to national high schools; the competition\nDocument [3]: [Technology.Future] Apollo’s Nightmare: Returning to the Moon is also an employment issue | Hong Kong 01 | Weekly Report When it came to the United States and mankind’s first moon landing, NASA was eager to defeat the Soviet Union and adopted the fastest feasible method instead of doing it for the first time. Establishing a clear path for future space or lunar missions. NASA has tightened other tasks, such as delaying plans to launch a probe to search for life on Mars. So no part of the Apollo program was built for the long term. Does this hinder the United States’ decades-long plan to return to the moon? Continuing from the above: [Technology.Future] With the Cold War and the Space Race no longer in place, who still supports the United States’ return to the moon? “They are only enough to send a team of people to land. to the moon and back," said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. Blair DeWitt, CEO of Lunar Station Corporation, a space data startup, explained: "Rather than logically building a sustainable model step by step for long-term landings and missions on the moon, it is more like jumping to the lunar surface in one big leap. This The abnormal market structure neglected to establish various ways to support the supply chain required to continuously transport equipment, materials and people to the moon." In other words, the "Apollo Project" did not actively lay the foundation for future human space activities. Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos pointed out at the Kennedy Library Space Summit in June that space still lacks the infrastructure to allow hundreds of flowers to bloom: "The real problem with being creative in space is that the admission fee is too high, unlike in the past twenty years. The entrepreneurial dynamics we've seen on the Internet in the past two decades are that you can start a company in a college dormitory and turn it into a giant company. This is not a metaphor. This is what I founded Amazon. It took very little money because someone else had done all the heavy lifting. I didn’t need to build a transportation system to deliver the goods, it already existed, it’s called the post office; I didn’t need to build a payment system, the credit card already existed, and so on.” Like SpaceX, it is developing a large reusable rocket New Glenn to reduce the cost of launch, which is what Bezos said is to reduce the admission fee. Logsdon believes, "What Apollo did was create a space industry cluster." NASA bases such as the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi ), the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, etc., were all built for the Apollo program and continue to manufacture rocket hardware for NASA. While the Apollo program employed 400,000 people at its peak, these factories now create thousands of jobs and invest billions of dollars in local economies. Artemis, NASA’s next wave of manned lunar landings, is no exception. “The\nDocument [4]: [Technology. Future] What is Bezos’ first step to realize his dream of colonizing space? | Hong Kong 01 | Weekly Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, once said that he would create the space company Blue Origin That is his most important job. At the beginning of last month, Bezos not only released the lunar lander "Blue Moon" to cooperate with NASA's manned return to the moon in 2024, but also once again elaborated on the vision of colonizing space, claiming to save the earth. the only way. How does Bezos plan to realize his space dream? Bezos realized the more fundamental problem of building a space colony: "This requires complete industrial supporting facilities. Thousands of companies will participate in the future, unleashing entrepreneurial activities and creativity." "People will come up with new ideas for using space. But these are not possible today because the entry fee is too expensive." Bezos recalled that although the company was poorly equipped when he founded Amazon, the infrastructure required for his success was already there. He believes that colonizing space should also build infrastructure first. (Screenshot of CBS program) He compared the situation when he founded Amazon in 1994. At that time, there was already the necessary major infrastructure, and you could rely on the US Postal Service, UPS and FedEx for delivery without building a transportation system; the payment system already had credit cards; Many families have computers, but space currently lacks these foundations: "My generation's job is to complete the infrastructure. We will build the road to space. It is impossible for two college students to build super interesting and interesting buildings in their dormitories. Important space company. If I can liberate 1,000 Zuckerbergs (Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder of Facebook) in the next generation, I will see unexpected things." Bezos believes that the current cost of launch is too high. (Reuters) Bezos believes that the cost of launch must first be significantly reduced and reusable large rockets must be developed. "This is the New Shepard rocket. The Blue Origin team has made good progress in reusing launch vehicles. We flew five times with two rocket boosters, with almost no refurbishments in between... You can't fake reuse, Even if the vehicle needs to be refurbished after recycling, it will be very expensive,” Bezos explained. At this point, Musk of SpaceX is on the same side. The company launched the reused Falcon 9 rocket for the first time in March 2017 and is designing the large rocket Starship, which it hopes to use to travel to Mars in the future. Bezos, like Musk, believes that colonizing space must first develop reusable rockets to reduce launch costs. The picture shows the vertical landing and recovery of the thruster of the Blue Origin New Shephard rocket in May this year. (Blue Origin photo) Blue Origin successfully completed the 11th test flight of the New Shepard rocket last month. It is expected to carry tourists on a short-distance suborbital space flight for the first time in the next few months. The next step will be to carry humans into orbit.\nDocument [5]: The private space craze brings new opportunities and challenges. On the 11th of this month, British tycoon Richard Branson crossed the skyline on a spaceship of his Virgin Galactic, becoming the first private space trip. Following him, on Tuesday (20th), the American tycoon and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his brother once again took a ride on the Blue Origin, his space exploration company. The capsule successfully challenged space travel. Recently, the space craze of the 1970s and 1980s has returned again. The biggest difference from back then is that today’s “space craze” is no longer limited to the national level, and the private sector is also trying hard to join this “space craze”. The universe is vast and full of areas unknown to mankind. Since the beginning of human civilization, humans have been full of curiosity about this unknown space. It is recorded in the Bible that the ancestors of mankind built the Tower of Babel just because they wanted to tower into the clouds and have the top of the tower reach the sky. In modern times, in addition to the primitive curiosity of human beings about space, it also has a political meaning: whichever country masters space technology can become a technological power. + 8 Space exploration from the official to the private sector. During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the competition between the two countries in space technology could be regarded as a competition that devoted all their national resources. The success of space exploration is not only a symbol of one's own national strength and comprehensive science and technology, but also related to national security. The widespread use of satellites and the emergence of global positioning systems have made mankind aware of the possibility of space war. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States lost its competitors in the competition for space, and the "space fever" temporarily cooled down. Indeed, in recent years, China has gradually risen and put its energy into space technology and exploration, and the "space fever" in the new era has been ignited again. But what is different from the past is that this new "space craze" is no longer just a competition between great powers. With the advancement of science and technology, the private sector also wants to join this craze on its own. It goes without saying that Branson and Bezos have already succeeded. There are also some examples that have not yet succeeded but are in the research stage. For example, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, also founded the SpaceX project and is committed to developing space travel and Transportation technology. Moreover, SpaceX has signed contracts with the U.S. Space Agency (NASA) and the Air Force to develop more efficient launch devices and reduce the cost of space transportation. It can be seen that private forces have even in turn affected the official space program. New opportunities also bring new problems. However, although many people are looking up to space, many people are not convinced by the private space craze.\nDocument [6]: Silver!

(Photo by Reporter Wang Hanping) 2019-09-02 14:32 [Reporter Wang Hanping/Tainan Report] Private Nanguang High School participated in the 2019 Siyuan Science and Technology Creativity Competition. Five students including Weng Kunze, Zhang Ruxin, Wang Baiyong, Li Jiaqi, and Cai Xinrui formed the "Never say die" team Winning the Silver Medal Award, the school publicly commended it today. The 2019 Siyuan Science and Technology Creativity Competition Plus attracts nearly a thousand high school students to form teams every year. In addition to dominoes, scientific knowledge must also be incorporated into the design of creative science levels to show creativity. This year, a total of 57 teams entered the semi-finals, and 16 teams advanced to the national finals. Weng Kunze said that "Never say die" is the name of the team because he hopes not to be discouraged when encountering difficulties. As long as he works hard and persists, he will be able to overcome and achieve the task. "Never say die we can do it" is really "silver". . The school stated that the purpose of the competition is to enable young students to experience the fun of hands-on science. The competition targets high school vocational students across the country and consists of teams of 4 to 6 students. The participating teams must design 4 levels. Each level displays the principles of physics and chemistry. The levels are connected by dominoes. The content of the levels is not designed. The theme of the annual competition will be "Our Song". The Nam Kwong team assembled various dominoes, based on the background of the song "Go Forward" and the concept of a train. They designed an electronically controlled induction device to trigger the Tyndall effect. They also used the current magnetic effect, potassium permanganate and the oxidation of glycerin. The reduction reaction and other factors show the idea that the theme wants to convey. Finally, the acid-base neutralization reaction is used to present the rainbow effect, which brings a perfect ending to the entire level. Zheng Qiaofen, the academic director of Nam Kwong High School, said that the 108 curriculum is on the road, focusing on the curriculum results and diverse performance of students in the learning process. The school has always encouraged students and other schools to observe each other, hoping to implement them during the competition process, and continue to nurture creativity and creativity.

Image copyright Blue Origin Image caption The new rockets developed by the private sector will challenge the traditional pattern of rocket launches. From the launch of the former Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957 to 1961, Since Gagarin landed on the moon, human exploration of space has basically been a battle for space supremacy between the United States and Russia (the former Soviet Union), the old enemies of the Cold War, with the private sector playing only a supporting role. After the end of the Cold War, the space race has also undergone earth-shaking changes. We are witnessing a revolution: technological advances are changing the traditional model of exploring space. Increasingly, it is private companies that are pitching in and paying, promoting lower-cost options such as reusable rockets and horizontal launch systems. Investment money poured into the aerospace industry. In 2016, the global space economy reached US$329 billion, three-quarters of which came from the private sector. Artificial satellites are getting smaller and smaller, and their construction costs are getting lower and lower. There are already about 1,500 in the sky orbiting the Earth. Massive amounts of data and images are continuously transmitted back to the earth from space, and commercial value is realized through computer processing, interpretation, and marketing. Image copyright EPA Image copyright NASA Image caption In the past, space exploration was only possible if national governments had enough human, financial and material resources to attempt it. Rockets are the key to connecting the earth and the vast starry sky. In this field, it is the billionaires who lead the way. SpaceX, the American technology wizard Elon Musk (the founder of Tesla), uses the Falcon 9 launch vehicle to deliver supplies to the International Space Station; Amazon's Bezos' company Blue Origin is developing new rockets New Shepard and New Glenn. Both companies have mastered groundbreaking technology for vertical landing, an important milestone in the development of multiple-use launch systems. Meanwhile, wealthy businessman Richard Branson's Virgin Group is developing technology to launch satellites from the sky. His plans to develop a commercial space tourism business also continue. New Zealand's Rocket Lab has also joined today's space race, hoping to change the way humans explore space. The company is still in its infancy, but it is the only rocket manufacturing company on Earth with its own launch site; its launch site is on the Mahia peninsula in New Zealand's North Island. The essence of a rocket can be said to be no different from the Sputnik era in 1957, that is, it must break through the earth's gravity to send the carried object into orbit. Image copyright Blue Origin Image caption Reusable rockets will significantly reduce the cost of launching man-made space vehicles. However, company founder Peter Beck said that if this concludes that Rocket Laboratory's products are just another A new rocket, that would be wrong. Currently, the average cost of launching a satellite is about US$200 million, and the United States\nDocument [8]: [Going to study in the United States] Hong Kong’s playgrounds are “too safe” and lose the fun and excitement. Hong Kong mothers living in the United States: Taking risks does not equal danger ▲ Taking risks does not equal danger. Hong Kong's education market has "Hong Kong characteristics" and is constantly innovating. Last time I talked to you about "Primary One Interview Class", this time I will talk about "Household Playground". I recently had a conversation with a friend in Hong Kong. Halfway through, the master arrived and wanted to drive some explosive screws, so he hurriedly cut the wires. My head was full of water, what happened was such a big battle. An hour later, he asked me back. I asked him if the house was undergoing repairs. He smiled and talked, and set up some climbing frames and rope nets in the house for Ah Zai to discharge his energy. Out of curiosity, I asked other friends. I was really shocked to find out that many people had installed similar sports facilities in their houses early in the morning. As consultants working on related suspension facilities, they used to mainly provide home solutions for sensory therapy. However, in recent years, more and more parents just want their children to have fun. The reason is even more unexpected, not because it is inconvenient to go out on the streets due to the epidemic, but because Hong Kong’s amusement parks are “very boring”. Therefore, many parents have no choice but to build their own playground at home. Park playgrounds are "too safe" Once upon a time, the park downstairs of our house was our favorite place. The iron slides that are as high as two floors, the flying tangpan turns, and the intricate horse trellises are all endless memories. The playground back then was a real "amusement" place where you could have fun. There, we made the most pure and true friends, and imagined all the nonsense in the world. You can also find pleasure in height and speed, and gain confidence in challenges and adventures. In contrast, today's playgrounds are almost all equipped with the largest off-the-shelf components. Euphemistically called, safer and easier to maintain. As everyone knows, fun and excitement are sacrificed. Statistics show that 99% of the slides in playgrounds managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department are currently only two meters or less. No more adventure, no more childhood. When the playground is abandoned by Xilu: it’s boring, too sexy, and not exciting; when Xilu would rather sit on the ground floor of the park, playing with mobile phones and iPads; when we pursue safety too much, children often complain about having sex, and the government is shocked Carrying a wok; in fact, the danger is gradually approaching, but we don't know it.

Nam Kwong High School won the silver medal in the 2019 Siyuan Science and Technology Creativity Competition. 2019-09-02 15:10 Lianhe Bao reporter Lianhe Bao reporter Xie Jinsheng/immediately reported the results of the 2019 Siyuan Science and Technology Creativity Competition Plus national finals It’s out; the “Never say die” team composed of students from Nanguang High School in Xinying, Tainan, including Weng Kunze, Zhang Ruxin, Wang Baiyong, Li Jiaqi, and Cai Xinrui, went through the preliminary and semi-finals and won the silver medal in the finals. The Siyuan Science and Technology Creativity Competition is a very iconic science competition in China. Every year, nearly a thousand high school students form teams to participate in the preliminary competition. In addition to dominoes, they also need to incorporate scientific knowledge into the design of creative science levels to show their creativity. This year, a total of 57 teams entered the semi-finals, and 16 teams advanced to the national finals, each showing their skills based on scientific principles. The participating Nam Kwong High School students concentrated on assembling various dominoes. Based on the background of the song "Go Forward" and the concept of a train, they designed an electronically controlled induction device to trigger the Tyndall effect. They also used the current magnetic effect, potassium permanganate and the addition of The oxidation-reduction reaction of glycerol, etc., shows the idea that the theme wants to convey. Finally, the acid-base neutralization reaction is used to present the rainbow effect. The theme is closely related to "Our Song", giving a new look to the rigid physical and chemical reactions in the textbook. Participating student Weng Kunze said that the name of the team was "Never say die" because he hoped not to be discouraged when encountering difficulties. As long as he works hard and persists, he will be able to overcome and achieve the task. "Never say die we can do it" won the silver medal this time. , we are really "silver". Zheng Qiaofen, the academic director of Nam Kwong High School, said that the school has always attached great importance to the teaching of natural subjects, invested a lot of effort in stimulating students' potential, and won numerous awards in external competitions.

The teachers and students of the school are excited.\nDocument [10]: "The Leader": Make science and technology "high but not cold" - News Morning News official website ■The series of interview programs "Future Talk Season 2: The Leader" will be broadcast tonight ■ Showcase the latest scientific research results and scientific research of 16 scientists in 8 key scientific research fields Cheng Chenbao reporter Yin Yin Face transplantation, driverless driving, fear memory erasure... These magical "stunts" are not science fiction movies, but come from around us. In the series of interview programs "Future Talk Season 2: Leaders", top elites from all walks of life will show the public the achievements of Shanghai's technological innovation in recent years. The program will be broadcast on Shanghai TV Station News Channel at 22:30 every night from July 21st to July 28th. There is information - 16 scientists show off their "magic skills", a powerful weapon of great power, who is the leader? In just 8 episodes of the program, programs from "Space Exploration", "Medical Attack", "Artificial Intelligence", "Shanghai Brain-Intelligence Project", "Ocean Exploration", "Brain Mystery", "Bioengineering", "Media Sixteen scientists and their teams in eight key scientific research fields of "New Evolution" presented their latest scientific research results and scientific research processes to the public, outlining an inspiring innovation map. From the key technologies of Beidou navigation and location services, the "Wukong" dark matter particle detection satellite, the manned deep submersible "Rainbow Fish" and the international abyssal science and technology mobile laboratory, "Jinghai" series of unmanned boats and other key projects, to Xinsong dual-arm collaborative robot, iFlytek translator, Cambrian smart chip, "urban mobile space" driverless car system and other intelligent cutting-edge technologies; from non-human primate autism model to fear memory elimination , visible light communication and other basic research, to the transformation and application of 7 kinds of micro-ribonucleic acid liver cancer detection kits, DNA complex kinship identification system, facial reconstruction technology, new fire-resistant paper and other achievements, each of these sounds a bit esoteric and complicated "professional names" , in fact, it is closely related to each of our lives. The 16 scientists selected for the program include academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, staff from the frontline of scientific research, and high-tech entrepreneurs active in the capital market. But what they have in common is that they all show their true thoughts in this program. history and deep scientific original intention. Some people may be curious about how these scholars who have been immersed in the front line of scientific research for a long time were persuaded to record the program? Producer Wang Ning admitted that many scientists did have concerns about being on the program, but when they heard that this program was For the sake of popularizing science, they unanimously agreed, "We do this program because we hope to let them express more about their mental journeys in addition to science, and also let more ordinary viewers understand their fields. It can be said that for the sake of popularizing science, they all He invested a lot of enthusiasm and did not expect anything in return.

American billionaire Jeff Bezos, who invests in the development of space technology, showed what the soft landing of the New Shepard reusable rocket, which his company Blue Origin plans to use for tourist flights to an altitude of about 100 km, looks like from the outside. On January 23, New Shepard made its 10th flight: the capsule did not contain people or mannequins, but various NASA scientific equipment. It and the main stage were separately returned to Earth in a controlled manner. Advertisement #NewShepard flew 8 @NASA research & technology payloads to space today.

Today I put on my lucky shoes, but, I think it’s actually the incredible Blue Origin team that made it successful,” the billionaire added. Photo: instagram.com/jeffbezos New Shepard is a system for commercial suborbital flights, consisting of a single-stage reusable launch vehicle (LV) and a passenger capsule. It operates completely autonomously: the flight is controlled by an on-board computer, and not by a pilot or engineers on the ground. The 18-meter rocket is named after Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut to make a suborbital flight. The BE-3 (Blue Engine 3) engine runs on hydrogen and oxygen. During a 110-second flight, it develops thrust of up to 490 kilonewtons. The stage is then separated from the capsule and lands independently using the engine. The cabin, designed for 6 passengers, flies upward by inertia for some time, reaching the Karman line (the conventional boundary between the atmosphere and space, about 100 km) and going beyond it, after which it lands with parachutes. The first space tourists will be charged $200-300 thousand for the joy of a 10-minute flight to suborbital altitude. Development of the system began in 2006. For its own cosmodrome, the company, which is owned by the world's richest man Jeff Bezos, acquired 770 square meters. km of land in Texas. In 2015, the launch vehicle and capsule were successfully launched for the first time.

So, one of the teams was puzzled by the creation of black silicon - a coating that will prevent sterilization of medical instruments. With its help, you can get universal, reusable antibacterial tweezers and scalpels, which can be simply washed after surgery. “And black titanium, due to its biocompatibility, will replace all implants,” says Lev Siov, a ninth-grader from Yekaterinburg. “But there is no technology for applying new materials to medical instruments yet. We are currently developing a precise technique for producing black silicon using reactive ion etching. Another team presented a mathematical model of the epidemiological process of rotavirus infection. This will allow Rospotrebnadzor to predict the incidence of disease in the population two months in advance and carry out timely prevention. As one of the developers explains, Artem Khachaturov, you just need to substitute the night air temperature (the spread of rotavirus mainly depends on it) into a special equation: tests have shown that an error is possible only in five percent of cases. Based on the methodology, similar formulas can be created for other territories and diseases. One of the projects already has an investor - a Ural company is ready to take over the production of a solid oxide fuel plant. By the way, medicine has become one of the most popular topics for young innovators. For example, the guys offer a posture corrector that does not hinder movement, does not fix the back, and specifically teaches a person not to slouch. It looks like a T-shirt, the effect is based on the fact that electromyography sensors read muscle movements, a special application processes this data and, if the position is incorrect, transmits a signal to vibration motors, which with light shocks make it clear which shoulder to straighten. The guys calculated that the estimated cost of smart clothes would be about two thousand rubles. Utility workers might be interested in a robotic pipe walker that allows them to find defects in polymer pipes and eliminate them using 3D printing, and energy workers might be interested in a natural gas filling station with a solid oxide fuel cell module installed that generates electricity to charge electric vehicles. “Electric vehicles are not widely used because there is no appropriate infrastructure,” says Yulia Volkova, associate professor of the Department of Thermal Power Engineering and Heat Engineering at the Energy Institute of UrFU. “We have an investor - a Ural manufacturing company that has already produced a prototype of a solid oxide fuel plant, albeit with much less power than what the guys’ project requires. The industrial partner is ready to take over production. And Gazprom responded to our letter that it was very interested in this kind of development and was ready to support the pilot project. Perhaps the most difficult direction is space: it is still too far from real life. “Nevertheless, high school students generate truly original and promising ideas that are in line with current trends in\nDocument [3]: Billionaire Bezos's company will auction off a ticket to space flight “On July 20, New Shepard will send its first crew of astronauts into space. We are offering one seat on the first flight to the winner of the online auction,” Blue Origin said. This is stated on the company's website. Billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space company will auction off one ticket for a suborbital excursion on the New Shepard spacecraft.

A group of graduate students from the University of Southern California (USC) launched the first amateur rocket in history to reach space. Their achievement, if confirmed, ends a decade-long informal competition among engineering schools around the world to create the first university rocket for space flight, representatives of the University's Rocket Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement, Hi-Tech writes. Internal analysis indicates that the student spacecraft Traveler IV crossed the Karman line, which represents the international boundary of space at an altitude of approximately 100 km above sea level. “The analysis confirmed this achievement with 90 percent confidence,” USC officials added. More than 90 students from the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory participated in the creation of the rocket. This project took 15 years and over a million hours of work. The school noted that many graduates who started working on the rocket are already collaborating with large American corporations such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. Two former students founded their own startup, Relativity Space. The students launched the rocket from New Mexico's Spaceport America, where space tourism provider Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant. The rocket reached a maximum recorded altitude of 103.6 km and a maximum speed of about 5,449 km/h.\nDocument [5]: 15 schoolchildren (one from Slavyansk-on-Kuban) reached the finals of the Belki-2019 competition /Education/ Fifteen schoolchildren reached the finals of the Belki-2019 competition and in March will help save the lives of seal pups using operational images of the Earth from space.

In addition, the teenagers presented to experts from the State Corporation Roscosmos and PJSC RSC Energia the development of space systems, which they had been working on for more than a month. A “Space Lesson” was held at Sirius the day before. Students from the Great Challenges educational program were able to ask questions to the astronauts on the ISS. In addition, the teenagers presented to the experts of the State Corporation Roscosmos and PJSC RSC Energia the developments of space systems that they had been working on for more than a month. As the Kuban State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company clarifies, under the Big Challenges program, 400 participants solve scientific cases in 12 relevant areas. 33 schoolchildren took up the “Space Technologies” area; they are conducting six projects under the guidance of industry partners. The topic of yesterday’s lesson was space experiments and their ground support. Alexander Chernyavsky, Advisor to the General Director of RSC Energia, said that many of the ideas that the students presented could. become part of the long-term ISS program. “The devices presented by the guys should participate in experiments; each of the projects deserves to be put into operation,” says Alexander Chernyavsky. The next step, according to experts: to attract young people to Russian rocket engine manufacturing enterprises, and also to create conditions. to work on the most important scientific and practical projects.\nDocument [7]: Blue Origin sold a place on a private space mission for $28 million The American private aerospace company Blue Origin sold the place of its first private flight into space for a person for $28 million, writes Engadget. The place was sold at auction. According to Blue Origin, nearly 7,600 people from around the world have registered to bid. The company will not disclose the name of the buyer in the coming weeks. It is known that he will take off on July 20 along with Blue Origin founder and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Engadget notes that the cost of the flight was influenced, among other things, by the opportunity to fly into space with one of the most influential technology executives in the world. The flight will be carried out by the company's reusable spacecraft for suborbital flights, New Shepard. The entire amount of donations is planned to be sent to Club for the Future, a Blue Origin foundation that aims to promote the careers of the younger generation in the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and space. The auction and the launch itself mark a symbolic victory for Blue Origin, writes Engadget. Although the company has lagged in human spaceflight, it is ahead of SpaceX and Virgin Galactic in space tourism, with rivals not planning to launch tourist flights until 2022. The main question now is the regularity of Blue Origin flights for paying passengers after the end of the first trip, writes Engadget. Setting up this system can be a much more difficult task than organizing the first flight.

Jeff Bezos, who announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Amazon CEO to devote more time to other projects including Blue Origin, said flying into space has been his lifelong dream. Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket has successfully completed more than a dozen uncrewed tests at its facility in the Guadalupe Mountains, Texas. The reusable suborbital rocket system was named after Alan Shepard, the first American in space 60 years ago.\nDocument [9]: Russian cosmonauts showed schoolchildren how to prepare pickle soup in zero gravity. Cosmonauts Sergei Ryzhikov and Sergei Kud-Sverchkov, who are now in orbit, got in touch with participants in the Russian Schoolchildren Movement (RSM) and showed how to prepare pickle soup with meat in zero gravity in a few minutes. The live broadcast from the International Space Station, in which more than 7 thousand schoolchildren took part, was timed to coincide with the Day of Heroes of the Fatherland. Chairman of the Russian Revolutionary School, pilot-cosmonaut and Hero of Russia Sergei Ryazansky said that the job of an astronaut is to strive to look into the unknown. “It is very important that our communication session with the ISS today took place on Heroes of the Fatherland Day. The guys saw that science, research, engineering and technology help the state and humanity as a whole to develop. In this creative research work there is also a moment of heroism, which is associated with overcoming, with the desire to look into the unknown and understand it. And now in the 21st century, space remains a place for heroes, and what boy, and girls too, does not dream of being a hero,” he said. Also during the live broadcast, RDS announced the launch of a new project “Scientific Orienteering: Open Space”. Project participants will create real CubeSat satellites and launch them into orbit. The organizers are confident that in this way schoolchildren will quickly become interested in the space field and feel involved in great discoveries and scientific developments. The project will also include online interactions with the professional community and astronauts, competitions and quizzes. The winners of the project will go on a space shift at Orlyonok, and the best ideas and proposals will be used when launching satellites into space in 2021.\nDocument [10]: Blue Origin showed what a flight on the New Shepard tourist spacecraft would be like [capsule video] Click here to share content on Facebook. (Opens in a new window) The other day, the aerospace company Blue Origin published a video, giving everyone the opportunity to watch the first launch of the new version of the New Shepard spacecraft with the Crew Capsule 2.0 capsule. Now Blue Origin has published another video taken from the capsule. Full video of Mannequin Skywalker’s ride to space. Unlike him, you’ll be able to get out of your seat during the zero gee part of the flight. And ignore the pinging sound – it’s just from one of the experiments on this flight. #NewShepard @blueorigin https://t.co/dJ5VEeaWb6 pic.twitter.com/qGQC1vfW7D — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 15, 2017 It is on this capsule that future space tourists will be able to travel beyond the border of the Pocket to spend a few minutes in zero gravity and see their home planet as they have never seen it before. As Blue Origin previously noted, the capsule received the largest windows of any spacecraft. Let us remind you that the capsule is designed for six passengers, and the first tourist flights of New Shepard are scheduled for 2019. The interior of the test capsule does not look as stylish and elegant as in the first concept images that the company published earlier this year. But this video, without unnecessary embellishment, demonstrates what future space tourists who decide to use the services of Blue Origin can expect. According to Bezos, during the flight, passengers will be able to temporarily unfasten their seat belts and leave their seats to fully enjoy the absence of gravity. And after descending back behind Earth, perhaps they can meet this Blue2D2 robotic technician (video below) serving the Blue Origin launch pad. Source: Blue Origin (YouTube)\n\nReport:

According to IRNA, Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Wednesday: The new strategy of the European Union regarding Russia is based on the three principles of distancing, deterrence and cooperation. He added: People who have decided such a strategy have difficulty in understanding and recognizing the history and accepting the facts. "Joseph Burrell", the head of the EU's foreign policy, has prepared the new EU strategy regarding Russia to be presented at the upcoming EU summit in Brussels, which will be held on June 24 and 25. The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry also rejected NATO's request to remove the United States and the Czech Republic from the list of unfriendly countries. According to IRNA, Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel on Tuesday: NATO member countries should determine their policy regarding Moscow if they do not want to be included in the list of unfriendly countries of Russia. The NATO summit was held in Brussels on Monday, and the leaders of the member states of this alliance asked Russia to remove the names of the United States and the Czech Republic from the list of unfriendly countries. Zakharova said: If I understood correctly, it seems that NATO intends to be friends with us with this request. Russia's relations with the West have been strained, and in response to the expulsion of its own diplomats, Moscow has expelled diplomats from the United States, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Bulgaria. The United States and the European Union have imposed dozens of economic and financial sanctions on Russia since 2014, and these measures continue to put pressure on the Russian leadership.\nDocument [2]: The leaders of 27 European countries emphasized on interaction with Russia to revive the JCPOA. According to IRNA's report on Friday, in this statement, a copy of which was published on the website of the European Union, it is stated: The European Council is ready to selectively interact with Russia in the interests of the Union. . It hereby asks the Commission and the European High Representative (responsible for foreign policy of the European Union) to present its plan with a view to cooperation on issues such as climate change, environment, foreign and multilateral policy issues such as JCPOA, Syria and Libya. The statement adds that the Council of Europe will examine various forms and terms of dialogue with Russia at the next meeting. Previously, the European Commission, by presenting a proposed document on the future of relations with Moscow, emphasized that despite the existing differences with the Russian government, the two sides should interact on a wide range of international challenges, including the revival of the JCPOA. This document, a version of which has been published on the European Union website under the title of "Suggestions for the Future of Relations with Russia" and is based on the three principles of distancing, deterrence and interaction, states: "The European Union must be able to cooperate with Russia in order to advance its interests." Interact on key challenges. The aforementioned document adds that the Corona epidemic was an expression of the constructive interaction of the two sides in the field of public health and it is necessary that we have close discussions with Russia regarding dealing with climate change and other environmental issues. This document proposed the development of technical interactions with the Moscow government and emphasized that cooperation in the field of preventing conflicts in the region and the world from Iran and the Middle East to Afghanistan, countering terrorism and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is essential. The senior diplomats of the 4+1 group and Iran have gathered in Vienna for the past three months to revive the Iran nuclear agreement, which the US withdrew from during the presidency of Donald Trump. During the last JCPOA joint commission meeting in Vienna, the delegations, while expressing their satisfaction with the progress made to revive the JCPOA, once again expressed their determination and seriousness to pursue the dialogue process with the aim of finding solutions for several issues that have not yet been resolved. They emphasized. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says the EU and Moscow should be able to work together on common interests. He told reporters last week that the relations between the two sides have reached the lowest level at the current stage and noted: Our goal should be to find ways to gradually change the situation towards a stable and predictable relationship.

Agreement on cyber security The President of Russia said: Regarding the issue of cyber security, we agreed to start consultations on this issue, which I think is an extremely important issue. Putin emphasized: "You just have to leave all the margins, sit at the expert level and work in the interests of the United States and the Russian Federation." He said: "We agreed on this in principle, and Russia is ready for this." Criticism of the unilateral US sanctions, referring to the US unilateral sanctions, the Russian President said: "Washington's losses are not less than the unilateral sanctions imposed by Moscow. The agreement for the return of Putin's ambassadors, stating that Russia and the US are trying to find a solution to the existing issues." The ambassadors of Russia and the United States resume their work. It was in March that the president of the White House called his Russian counterpart a "murderer". Moscow has remained, and of course, Russia also forced the American ambassador to leave this country. There was no hostility between the two sides, he clarified: There was no hostility between the two sides and we only had differences about issues. Russia and the United States are trying to find a solution to the existing issues and have a special responsibility for global security, and we accept this responsibility. He stated that in the meeting with Biden, it was agreed to start the consultations in the field of strategic stability, and clarified: the talks were constructive; The desire to find a way to bring the positions closer was expressed by the parties. Putin also said that the diplomatic agencies of Russia and the United States will work on the issue of the exchange of convicts between the two countries. Regarding the difference between the military exercises of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin also said: Like the United States, Russia conducts military exercises on its own borders, but it does not carry out exercises that bring its equipment to the borders of the United States. He announced: Russia does not conduct military exercises near the American borders, but the Americans are doing this right now. America has sanctioned two Russian media outlets. He said: There is such a reality regarding the distortion of my words in the media and we are used to it. This issue has existed for decades. Putin stated: Russia has Rashatudi and Sputnik, which operate at the international level, and the United States has sanctioned these two media. But American media operate in Russia. We did not initiate all the measures leading to the deterioration of relations with America, and the members of the American Congress were involved in this issue. He stated: "We did not feel any pressure during Biden's meeting, neither from us nor\nDocument [4]: The American ambassador returned to his country/Moscow: We hope that the visit will be fruitful. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed hope that the visit of the American ambassador John Sullivan to Washington will be fruitful and will help prevent the deadlock of bilateral relations. According to ISNA, citing Sputnik news agency, Sullivan left for Washington earlier today (Thursday). He went to Washington to consult with the Biden administration and is scheduled to return to Moscow within a few weeks. "We have heard many interesting comments about where and why the US ambassador should go," Zakharova said. Some said that he had not been to his homeland for a long time, others said that he wanted to see his relatives. The White House and the US State Department said consultations would take place. I think Washington should comment on the activities and travels of the US ambassador. We made our position clear: due to the level of bilateral relations, it is necessary to consult with both ambassadors. He added: "Consultations with our ambassador to the United States are now underway in Russia." We hope that the US ambassador will also spend his time in Washington effectively and focus on consulting with agencies that handle bilateral relations with Russia to adopt a position that prevents a stalemate in relations. The US Embassy in Moscow confirmed today (Thursday) that the US Ambassador to Russia has left this diplomatic institution and is on his way to Washington. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last Friday that the Russian side advised US Ambassador John Sullivan to return to Washington for consultations on bilateral relations. The US Embassy announced: We confirm that Ambassador Sullivan is on his way to Washington DC. John Sullivan will make a short trip to meet with his family and consult with the administration officials of US President Joe Biden. He is scheduled to return to Moscow within the next few weeks. Earlier this month, the United States imposed new sanctions on 32 Russian entities and individuals as part of a new round of sanctions over Moscow's alleged cyberattacks and other hostile actions against American interests. The United States also expelled 10 Russian diplomats from this country and warned American institutions against buying ruble-based bonds. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia condemned the new round of sanctions and considered them to be against the interests of the two countries. In response, Russia banned eight US citizens from entering the country, notably US Attorney General Merrick Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Director of National Intelligence April Hines and FBI Director Christopher Wray. end of message\nDocument [5]: Russia's threat to retaliate against America's hostile action, according to the report of the Young Journalists Club International Group, quoted by Independent, after Joe Biden's hostile action in expelling Russian diplomats, Moscow reacted to this action. According to this report, after US President Joe Biden announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats and imposed sanctions against the Kremlin for allegedly meddling in the elections, Russia threatened to retaliate. Sergei Ryabkov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, said in a speech: A series of retaliatory measures will be implemented in the near future. It should be noted that yesterday, the US government imposed sanctions against Moscow, claiming Russia's interference in the 2020 presidential elections, cyber attacks, what it described as bullying against Ukraine and other "malicious" actions. Also, the White House spokesman claimed that the recent US sanctions against Russia are not a source of tension. Jennifer Psaki said: The new sanctions against Russia are not tensions, but the cost of some unacceptable actions against us or our allies. Yesterday, the United States sanctioned 32 Russian institutions and personalities for what it called interference in the recent elections of this country. In addition to the new sanctions, this country expelled 10 Russian diplomats from its territory. These diplomats have been accused of espionage. Also, in a speech on Thursday, Joe Biden claimed that if Russia interferes in American democracy, he will take retaliatory measures. Biden also presented his proposal regarding holding a meeting with Putin in the summer. end of message/\nDocument [6]: Will Russia's sanctions response deter Washington? According to IRNA from Moscow, Russian officials reacted harshly to the new sanctions of the United States and, as they say, "saved" things for the day of the trade war. Of course, the United States called Russia's response to the sanctions "aggravating and deplorable" and reserved the right to respond to Moscow's actions, although it does not believe that the tension is in their interest. Moscow called Washington's requests to "refrain from escalating tensions" as "hypocritical" and emphasized that Russia will not allow any government to speak to it from a "position of strength". Russian officials told the US ambassador in Moscow that the Washington government should refrain from new sanctions if it wants to improve relations, however, the White House on Thursday (April 27) accused Russia of cyber abuse and meddling in the 2018 presidential election. Last year, it sanctioned 32 Russian institutions, including the expulsion of diplomats. These sanctions also prohibit the purchase of ruble-denominated securities from June. "We have repeatedly warned and proven that sanctions and pressure are not only useless, but will also lead to disastrous consequences for those who decide on such provocations," the Russian Foreign Ministry recalled. At the same time, Russia's response to the new US sanctions was made public on Friday evening (April 27) after the meeting of the Russian Security Council. First, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke about retaliatory measures, and a little later a more detailed message about retaliatory measures regarding hostile actions by the United States was published on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. John Sullivan, the US Ambassador to Russia, was also invited to the Kremlin Palace, where Yuri Ushakov, Vladimir Putin's assistant, informed him of Moscow's sanctions response. In addition, John Sullivan was requested to return to his country for the purpose of consultation, like the Russian ambassador to America who came to Moscow for consultation. But 10 American diplomats will be expelled from Russia forever, and all Russian citizens working in the American embassy must resign. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia made it clear that Moscow has prepared stricter measures if Washington continues to escalate tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia announced in a statement: "The next attack" by US President Biden against Russia cannot go unanswered. "Washington seems unwilling to accept the fact that in the new geopolitical realities there is no room for unilateral dictatorship and the 'bankrupt scenarios of Moscow's containment', which the United States is short-sightedly pursuing," the statement added. It is only associated with the further destruction of the relations between Russia and the United States.'' First, John Sullivan was advised to go to his capital and do detailed and serious consultations there." Similarly, Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the United States, has also come to Moscow for consultations since March 20. Of course, a diplomatic official has told the Russian media that John Sullivan does not want to leave Moscow. The American embassy has not given an explanation on this matter either. But\nDocument [7]: US Sanctions Russia Over 'Cyber ​​Attack' US Sanctions Russia Over 'Cyber ​​Attack' 55 minutes ago Image source: EPA Image caption Joe Biden is likely to announce details of sanctions today The United States in response to what the cyber attacks has announced a wide range of sanctions against Russia. The White House said Thursday that the sanctions, detailed in an executive order signed by Joe Biden, are aimed at preventing Russia's "harmful foreign activities." These sanctions target 32 ​​Russian institutions and include the expulsion of diplomats. The United States also accuses Russia of cyber abuse and interference in the 2020 presidential election. These sanctions also prohibit the purchase of ruble-denominated securities from June. The announcement comes at a time when US-Russian relations have been strained. This is the second round of major sanctions against Russia after last month's sanctions in response to the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a critic of the Russian government, which included sanctions on seven mid-ranking and senior Russian officials and more than a dozen institutions of that country. Russia says it had no role in his poisoning. In a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Joe Biden said the United States would act "firmly in defense of our national interests." At the same time, he also requested to meet with Mr. Putin "in a third country" in order to provide the opportunity to examine common areas of cooperation. But Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president's office, said the new sanctions, which he described as illegal, would not help the request to hold the summit. image copyrightReuters image captionPutin is said to be considering Biden's request for a meeting would give Intelligence experts believe that Russia was responsible for this attack. Hackers gained access to the digital files of several US government agencies, including the Departments of Treasury and Justice, and several government departments. In February, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith said the malware was the "largest and most sophisticated" program of its kind ever seen. Last December, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Russia was behind the attack, but added that US investigators were "still working to figure out the exact details of the attack". A few months later, the United States is now considering formally accusing Russian intelligence agencies of carrying out the hack. Russia has denied any involvement in this cyber operation. Analysis by security reporter Gordon Correra Last year, news of a major cyberattack by SolarWind software left the US government dismayed and questions about how to respond to it. Some members of Congress called it an "act of war" and called for retaliation, but others pointed out that the Russians were engaged in exactly the same kind of espionage that America is engaged in online. Finally, the Biden government came to the conclusion that the dimensions of the intrusion in the American systems were to such an extent that it required an appropriate response. But the question was, what should this answer be? Some answers will be given "covertly" and will probably use cyber attacks to harm the perpetrators.\nDocument [8]: White House: Sanctions against Russia are not a cause of tension, according to the International Group of Young Journalists Club, quoted by Al Jazeera, White House spokesperson Jennifer Saki claimed that the recent US sanctions against Russia are not a cause of tension. Jennifer Psaki said: "The new sanctions against Russia are not tensions, but the cost of some unacceptable actions against us or our allies." Today, the United States sanctioned 32 Russian institutions and personalities for what it called interference in the recent elections of this country. In addition to the new sanctions, this country expelled 10 Russian diplomats from its territory. These diplomats have been accused of espionage. The banking sanctions imposed by the executive order of US President Joe Biden will take effect on June 14. In addition to 32 Russian individuals and institutions, 6 Russian companies active in the field of technology have also been included in the sanctions list. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had previously said: "The United States has taken a foolish approach against Moscow, and we will respond to any kind of sanctions imposed against Russia." Recently, America has suggested that a meeting be held between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin; The Russian Presidential Palace (Kremlin) had announced that it would review the American proposal, but after the imposition of sanctions, Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, described this action as a disruption to the improvement of relations between the two countries. Maria Zakharova said: "Recent US sanctions cast doubt on the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Biden." end of message/\nDocument [9]: Bloomberg: Putin is in a stronger position in negotiations with Biden. According to an IRNA report, Bloomberg wrote: Even when the price of oil is low, Russia can always use its other big export source, which is internet trolls. Disruption in social media and elections around the world could cost stocks high dividends. Biden is not as kind to Putin as former US President Donald Trump, but in his meeting with Putin, all the pressure is on him. In order to have an achievement in this meeting, Biden must look for common points and emphasize the interests of the United States without embarrassing the Russian president. Biden has previously called Putin a "murderer" and once accused him of having no feelings. Bloomberg wrote that Biden will probably put aside his problems with Putin in order to focus on the bigger problem, which is China. But Putin knows that this is exactly what Biden wants from this meeting, and for this reason, he will incur a heavy cost, so that the stock markets have not been able to incur such a cost for a long time. In March 2014 (March 2014), relations between the United States and Russia became strained under the pretext of the internal crisis in Ukraine under the administration of Barack Obama. The meeting between the presidents of Russia and the United States will be held today, Wednesday, at Villa La Grange in Geneva, Switzerland, and according to Moscow's announcement, it will last between four and five hours. The United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to return to dialogue with Russia to resolve disputes, however, in practice, it has continued its confrontational line and using economic, military-political, propaganda and other tools against Russia, hundreds of citizens and It has placed Russia's legal personality under various restrictions and has imposed dozens of sanctions against Moscow. Washington's last sanctions move against Moscow was this month, when America expelled 10 Russian diplomats and imposed a new package of sanctions on this country, and of course, in response, Russia also expelled 20 American diplomats.\nDocument [10]: Reduction in providing diplomatic services of the American Embassy in Russia, according to the report of the International Group of Young Journalists Club, citing Sputnik, the American Embassy in Russia announced that starting May 12th, it will provide only emergency consular services to American citizens and stop granting non-diplomatic visas. The American Embassy in Russia announced in a statement that starting May 12, the embassy of this country in Moscow will provide only important and emergency consular services. This reduction of services is due to the action of the Russian government on April 23, when Moscow announced that it would not grant visas to the United States for foreign nationals. The Washington Embassy in Moscow also asked American citizens in Russia to leave the country before June 15 if their visas expire. The US Embassy expressed regret that it was forced to cut 75% of its consular workforce due to the actions of the Russian government. On April 15, the US imposed new sanctions against Russia, affecting 32 individuals and organizations. The sanctions also prohibit US financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds during initial settlement after June 14. The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a retaliatory measure, prevented eight current and former American officials from entering Russia for an unlimited time and expelled many American diplomats in the Moscow embassy. Not long ago, Moscow announced a list of "countries unfriendly to Russia", with the United States at the top of these countries. "Ukraine, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Estonia, England and Georgia" were among the other countries mentioned in this list. end of message/\n\nReport:

The point of Western policy should be to deprive Putin's Russia of resources and potential that it can use to the detriment of others in the future. Alexander Belov, , 14:31 — REGNUM US sanctions imposed in April against several Russian banks, technology companies, individuals and partly against the country’s sovereign debt, became another step in the punitive campaign of Washington and its European allies against the Kremlin for “reckless and aggressive actions” against Russia’s neighbors and the West. Similar strict measures are increasingly being taken in European countries. Sanctions Alexander Gorbarukov © REGNUM News Agency Last week, by an overwhelming majority of votes (569 to 67), the European Parliament decided that in the event of renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine, “Russia should be excluded from the SWIFT payment system, and all assets in the EU of oligarchs close to the Russian government , and their families in the EU should be frozen and their visas revoked,” wrote Atlantic Council Fellow and former State Department Sanctions Policy Coordinator Daniel Fried and Atlantic Council Senior Fellow Adrian Karatnicki in a May 4 article in Foreign Policy. The recent round of sanctions has reignited debate over whether the measures taken are painful enough, whether they target the right people or whether they are even effective. In the end, the sanctions did not cause Russian President Vladimir Putin to change course. However, such criticism cannot be considered entirely convincing: prohibitive measures have already weakened Russia, limited its resources and the space for maneuver of its authorities. Over time and with additional measures, they could deprive the Kremlin of resources with which it could cause harm in the future. As is known, the United States and its allies have applied a wide range of sanctions in response to specific Kremlin misdeeds, including “political assassinations” in the EU, human rights violations, cyber attacks on Western governments, companies and institutions, the illegal “annexation” of Crimea and the continuation of the war of conquest in eastern Ukraine, which claimed the lives of more than 13 thousand people. The West has expelled Russian diplomats, imposed sanctions on individuals and companies and cut off Russia's access to a range of economic and financial transactions. War in Donbass. 2015 However, critics have long argued that such limited sanctions do little to contain Putin: they only harm ordinary Russian citizens and have negative consequences for the economies of Western countries that apply sanctions. Indeed, sanctions are a limited tool, especially in the short term. While sanctions imposed following the “Russian invasion” of Ukraine have likely helped deter Moscow from “larger aggression,” neither diplomacy nor the current level of sanctions have convinced Putin to “walk away from Ukraine” or prevent Russia’s continued interference in the US and US elections. in European countries. Piecemeal sanctions may now appear to be limited in scope and ineffective, but their long-term impact is\nDocument [2]: Ban almost everything: a list of unfriendly countries has been created “Ban almost everything”: a list of unfriendly countries has been created Russian authorities have compiled a list of countries unfriendly to the Russian Federation. As expected, it includes the USA, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic and the UK. It is possible that the list will expand. The decree on this was signed personally by the head of state, Russian President Vladimir Putin. We will find out the rest of the “non-friends” when the government order is published. This list means that: countries with this status will be deprived of the rights and opportunities traditional for diplomatic missions; the number of diplomatic staff will be limited; Russians will also not be able to work in the embassies of these countries; the movement of employees within the Russian Federation will be limited or even prohibited. As stated by the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, the list will be “living” and changeable. According to him, “we have drawn attention to the fact that if someone wants to establish parity, then parity will also apply to the hiring activities in our country of Russian citizens - individuals, citizens of third countries, since in this component there is any parity is completely absent. We do not have such practice." Lavrov also stressed that Russia will not indiscriminately add any country to the list of “unfriendly” countries - the decision will be preceded by a deep analysis. But such a decision is overdue; Russia has no other choice. In relations with other countries, systemic measures are needed to bring our partners to their senses. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova explained that the United States is number one on the entire list. “As you understand and as I can confirm this, naturally, the United States appears on the list,” Zakharova said. She clarified that “the whole story began with the next round of unfriendly actions by the United States.” In fact, restrictions on the hiring of Russians to work in diplomatic missions, up to a complete ban, are a response to US sanctions. Most likely, the “unfriendly” list in its final form will not be very large, but the United States, the Baltic countries and the Czech Republic will certainly be included in it, explained Oleg Shein, a member of the State Duma Committee on Labor, Social Policy and Veterans Affairs. “The large countries of Western Europe - for example, Germany and France - have different positions with Russia, but they are perceived by Moscow as some kind of conditional partners who are politically, economically and militarily dependent on Washington,” Shein explained, noting that for all that The EU is perceived by Russia as a party to the negotiations. And the deputy chairman of the council of the Association of Russian Diplomats, Andrei Baklanov, spoke in the spirit that this measure is completely forced and temporary. Such steps have to be taken due to the aggravation of relations with these countries due to the fault of their leadership. This format dragged\nDocument [3]: The United States encouraged Europe to respond to Russian aggression with sanctions, - Kerry Read on "Censor.NET": US Senators will present in Congress a draft on "comprehensive" sanctions against the Russian Federation. This was announced by US Secretary of State John Kerry, Censor.NET reports with reference to Interfax-Ukraine “We prompted Europe to impose sanctions (on Russia - Ed.). And these sanctions hit Russia hard, showing it that they (the Russian side - Ed.) must pay the price for this. We managed to extend them as part of our efforts designed to encourage (Russia - Ed.) to implement the Minsk agreements," John Kerry said on Tuesday at the Washington Institute of Peace. Let us recall that in 2014, the European Union, the United States, and other countries imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation in connection with the occupation of Crimea and aggression in eastern Ukraine, which were repeatedly expanded and extended. Negotiations on a visa-free regime and on a new basic cooperation agreement were suspended, a ban on entry into EU countries was introduced for officials from the Russian Federation and their assets were frozen, and restrictive measures of a trade, financial and military nature were introduced. In total, 151 people and 37 legal entities were included in the sanctions lists. Sectoral sanctions apply to 20 Russian financial, oil and defense structures. In August 2014, Russia introduced a package of measures in response to sanctions from the European Union, the USA, Australia, Canada and Norway. The so-called “counter-sanctions” were a one-year ban on the import of fruits, vegetables, dairy and meat products into the Russian Federation from these countries.\nDocument [4]: Russia will soon present a list of unfriendly countries - Lavrov The Russian government will soon present a list of unfriendly countries: the criteria are clear, there is not long to wait.

So, I think we won’t have to wait long,” the minister said. On April 15, the United States introduced new sanctions against Russia, covering 32 individuals and associations. The sanctions also prohibit American financial institutions from purchasing Russian government bonds during the initial offering after June 14.

The head of the diplomatic mission left for the US capital on April 22. In parallel, last week President Vladimir Putin signed a decree restricting foreign diplomatic missions engaged in unfriendly activities from hiring workers in Russia. Employment contracts previously concluded with individuals, the number of which exceeds that determined by the Russian government, are subject to termination.\nDocument [5]: The Chinese Foreign Ministry commented on the new US sanctions against Russia The Chinese Foreign Ministry commented on the new US sanctions against Russia Photo: REUTERS Unilateral American sanctions against Russia should be considered a manifestation of hegemony, which is opposed by the entire international community.

In addition, Washington announced that it was expelling ten Russian embassy employees from the country. The Foreign Ministry noted that the White House's sanctions policy does not meet the interests of the peoples of the two countries. The Kremlin's response to US sanctions consisted of both mirror and asymmetric measures. In particular, Moscow denounced the agreement on the travel of diplomats outside their home bases, and also prohibited the hiring of Russians or citizens of third countries to work in the mission. In addition, the Russian authorities have added the United States to the list of unfriendly states that are prohibited from hiring third-country nationals. The American Embassy, ​​due to Russian retaliation, announced a reduction in the volume of consular services provided and the cessation of processing applications for non-immigrant visas, with the exception of diplomatic trips from 12 May. Later, the embassy clarified that until July 16 they will continue to provide some consular services to US citizens.

State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin suggested in his Telegram channel that Moscow should expect further “claims” from Washington, which could affect domestic industry and the fuel and energy complex. “It is quite obvious that the development of Russia as a strong sovereign state is unprofitable. Moreover, the idea that our country can take its rightful place in the world is unacceptable for the United States and its allies,” he wrote, adding that Washington’s “hysteria” of late is connected to this. Volodin noted that other claims should be expected against Russia, given that the whole world has understood what standards of democracy and human rights protection apply in the United States. He suggested that the “strikes” aimed at domestic industry and the fuel and energy complex are intended to stop the country’s economic development. Washington on Thursday introduced new sanctions against Moscow, which covered 32 individuals and associations. American financial institutions were also prohibited from purchasing Russian government bonds during the initial offering after June 14. In addition, the United States is expelling ten diplomatic mission employees. Moscow the next day announced retaliatory measures: ten American diplomats were expelled from Russia, and the remaining ones would no longer be allowed to move freely around the country. Personal sanctions were also introduced against former and current officials from the administration, and the US Ambassador was recommended to leave for consultations https://ria.ru/20210419/ukraina-1728572359.html https://ria.ru/20210418/baydenizm-1728727440.html Moscow Russia USA RIA Novosti 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 FSUE MIA Rossiya Segodnya https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 2021 RIA Novosti 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 FSUE MIA "Russia Today" https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 News ru-RU https://ria.ru/ docs/about/copyright.html https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/ RIA Novosti 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 FSUE MIA "Russia Today" https://xn --c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 1920 1080 true 1920 1440 true 1920 1920 true RIA Novosti 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 FSUE MIA "Russia Today" https:// xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 RIA Novosti 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 FSUE MIA "Russia Today" https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn-- p1ai/awards/ 353 60 Moscow, in the world, State Duma of the Russian Federation, Russia, Vyacheslav Volodin, USA\nDocument [10]: Media: the US Secretary of State has prepared a program for the development of constructive relations with the Russian Federation NEW YORK, June 20. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has developed a program that outlines three main directions for establishing a constructive working relationship with Russia. The American resource BuzzFeed reported this on Monday, citing information from sources in the State Department. Three components According to them, the document prepared by Tillerson is classified and includes three main provisions. In the first, the emphasis is on proving to Moscow that a number of steps that Washington attributes to the Russian Federation are counterproductive for both sides. In particular, we are talking about the sale of weapons to the Taliban movement in Afghanistan and incidents with American diplomats in Moscow. In each individual case, the American side is invited to resist such actions. The second point of the program provides for establishing interaction with Russia in areas that meet the strategic interests of the United States. Among these are the cessation of the war in Syria, the defeat of the terrorist group "Islamic State" (IS, banned in the Russian Federation), the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and joint work in the field of cybersecurity. In third place is the importance of maintaining relations of “strategic stability” with Russia, notes the source of the resource. The role of neighbors is not spelled out. BuzzFeed's publication draws attention to the similarity of this document with the strategy of the Barack Obama administration in 2015, when the course towards a “reset” of relations with Russia began to steadily change towards cooling. Obama had a fourth point that is not in Tillerson's program. We are talking about providing all possible support to Russia’s neighbors in Eastern and Central Europe, including through NATO resources, the resource explained. In 2014, after the reunification of Crimea with the Russian Federation and the events in Ukraine, when the United States supported the transfer of power in this country to supporters of European integration, relations between the countries began to deteriorate sharply. The United States has frozen cooperation with Russia in many areas and imposed sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities. Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions, announced the suspension of the treaty on the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium and the freezing of two scientific programs in the nuclear field due to “the threat to strategic stability as a result of unfriendly actions.” At the end of 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on intelligence services and a number of individuals from the Russian Federation, accusing them of “election interference,” and announced the expulsion from the country of 35 Russian diplomats, whom Barack Obama called “Russian intelligence workers.”\n\nReport:

Until now, no other airport has attempted to use dogs' sense of smell to detect COVID-19 on this scale. We are very pleased with the initiative of the city of Vantaa. This measure can serve as an additional step towards defeating COVID-19,” said Ulla Lettieff, director of Helsinki Airport and member of Finavia’s management team. Photo: Helsinki Airport Dogs can detect COVID-19 quite easily, and the results so far are very encouraging. According to the results of preliminary tests carried out by a research group at the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Helsinki, dogs are able to detect the virus by smell with almost 100% accuracy. However, they can detect the presence of the virus several days before the first symptoms appear, and it is in this regard that laboratory tests are so far powerless.\nDocument [2]: At Helsinki Airport, dogs will be used to recognize those infected with COVID-19. At Helsinki Airport (Finland), an experiment will be launched in which dogs will be used to recognize those infected with COVID-19. Interfax reports this. It is noted that the project starts this week. A total of 16 specially trained dogs will take part in the pilot project. It is noted that the dogs will be allowed to sniff a napkin with which the passenger will first rub the skin. If a dog detects the virus, the passenger will be sent for a medical examination. The conclusion that dogs can recognize the smell typical of those infected with coronavirus was made by scientists at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Helsinki.

At this stage, the result is impressive: dogs are able to determine the presence of infection in the body faster than PCR tests. “Dogs at the airport showed almost 100% accurate detection of coronavirus, and without a five-day wait,” writes Express. How it works Arriving passengers are asked to line up for the test and wipe their skin with a tissue. The tissue is then placed in a jar for the dogs to sniff. Smell dogs are trained to indicate a positive test by barking or lying on the floor. If the dog alerts staff to what it considers a “positive test,” the passenger is given a nasal PCR test. To date, about 2,200 passengers have taken part in the experiment on a voluntary basis. The trial is expected to continue throughout December. According to Anna Hielm-Bjorkman of the University of Helsinki, who is overseeing the trial, using dogs could provide a cheap and fast alternative to PCR testing at airports. “Currently, this test costs about €300 thousand, but it is still cheaper than conducting PCR tests. There are currently 16 dogs trained by the Finnish organization Wise Nose,” Express writes. The organization has previously successfully trained its pups to detect cancer, Parkinson's disease and malaria. What scientists say Dr Claire Guest, CEO and co-founder of Medical Detection Dogs, said: "In principle, we are confident that dogs can detect COVID-19. We are now looking at how we can safely smell the virus from patients and present it to dogs " Professor James Logan, Chair of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Director of ARCTEC, said:\nDocument [8]: Understudy Day in Finnish: a 16-year-old girl will become the country's Prime Minister for a day "Understudy Day" in Finnish: a 16-year-old girl will become the country's Prime Minister for a day Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin, who recently married a former football player Markus Räikkönen, will give up his seat for one day to 16-year-old activist Aava Murto, allowing her to head the country's government. Rambler reports this with reference to the press service of the Finnish government. It is reported that the replacement of the country's head of government will take place on October 7 as part of the Girls Takeover program on the UN International Day of the Girl, which is celebrated on October 11. On this day, in countries that join the program, girls become leaders in various public spheres. During her day as Prime Minister, Aava Murtaugh will meet with the Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, the Chancellor of Justice and a Member of Parliament. They should discuss how to increase the ability of girls from vulnerable groups to use technology. And with the current Prime Minister of Finland, the activist will discuss how to improve the opportunities for girls to develop in the field of technology and how to prevent cyberstalking of young ladies. It is noted that such an event is being held in the country for the fourth time. In addition to the Prime Minister, other leaders are participating in the event: university rectors, editors-in-chief of various media, and general directors of commercial companies. Previously, FACTS wrote about another Finnish know-how: Helsinki Airport is conducting a unique experiment using dogs to identify patients with COVID-19. Animals sniff passengers and identify those who are infected. It is believed that dogs are able to smell an infection, even if the person himself does not yet know about the infection, and no symptoms have appeared. Canine specialists assure that their charges are able to smell the coronavirus at a stage when even a PCR test shows a false negative result.

There are now four coronavirus sniffer dogs in a government-funded pilot program. Finnish researchers hope dogs' olfactory skills will provide the country with a cheap, fast and effective alternative method for testing people for coronavirus. According to Anna Hilmi-Burkman from the University of Helsinki, a dog can detect the presence of coronavirus within 10 seconds, and the entire process takes less than a minute, writes The Guardian. If it works, the method could be used in hospitals, nursing homes, and at sporting and cultural events, the researcher adds. Passengers arriving from international flights are asked to wipe their neck with a tissue. In a separate booth, a jar with a napkin is placed next to others containing foreign odors, and the dog begins to sniff. If the dog reacts to the irritant, the passenger is recommended to do a PCR test. During testing, sniffer dogs, which were previously used to detect diseases such as cancer and diabetes, were able to identify the virus with almost 100% accuracy, even days before the patient first showed symptoms. Researchers in Australia, France, Germany and the UK are working on similar projects, but Finland is the first country in Europe to use dogs to detect coronavirus.\n\nReport:

Studies have revealed that the risk of contracting these diseases is higher - Life. If you stay up late for a long time or are under stress, your body will feel tight and unable to sleep, leading to insomnia. Insomnia is a common phenomenon that occurs in modern people, and most people are troubled by it. However, insomniacs should be careful. According to the latest foreign research, most insomniacs are more likely to suffer from stroke and heart disease than those who sleep normally. According to a recent study published in Neurology®, people with sleep problems may increase their risk of heart disease, stroke and other brain diseases. This study was conducted by Dr. Liming Li from Peking University and sampled 487,200 people in mainland China, with an average age of 51 years old. They will be asked whether they have had the following sleep symptoms on at least 3 days in a week: "difficulty falling asleep," "early risers," and "daytime sleepiness." There was no relevant history of stroke or heart disease before the investigation began. If you stay up late for a long time or are under stress, your body will feel tight and unable to sleep, leading to insomnia. Insomnia is a common phenomenon that occurs in modern people, and most people are troubled by it. (Photo/shutterstock) Through 10 years of follow-up interviews, 130,032 cases of stroke or heart attack were obtained. The survey results pointed out that people with three insomnia symptoms were 18% more likely to suffer from the disease than those without any of the symptoms; about 26% of people without sleep problems suffered from heart disease or stroke, and 32% of those with insomnia problems. In particular, "those who suffer from daytime depression" have a 13% higher incidence rate than those without such symptoms; "those who wake up early and are unable to fall asleep again" have a 7% higher incidence rate than those without such symptoms. Liming Li said that research on insomnia-related diseases is particularly easy to detect clues from young people and early-stage subjects. He said that in the future, he will also conduct early detection research on such people. Although this survey cannot directly conclude that there is a direct connection between insomnia and heart disease and stroke, it can be judged from the results that there is indeed some inevitable relationship between them. If the problem of people having difficulty falling asleep can be improved, it is expected to reduce the chances of strokes, heart attacks and other diseases in the future. (China Times Electronic News)\nDocument [2]: Research: Sleep disorders increase the risk of heart failure, and simple insomnia is more deadly (Central News Agency reporter Zhang Mingxuan, Taipei, 1st) If you can't sleep or sleep well, it can really kill you. The Third General Hospital tracked more than 20,000 patients with sleep disorders for 13 years and found that 1 in 6 people suffers from heart failure. Once diagnosed after 7 years, the risk will increase by 20%, and people who cannot sleep or have insomnia are at higher risk. . Wang Yiduo, a thoracic physician at the Tri-Service General Hospital, told the Central News Agency that sleep disorders are systemic diseases, including insomnia, circadian clock imbalance, sleepwalking, etc., which are quite common in Taiwan. On average, 25% of the people have this problem. If divided by gender, See, overall about 20% of men have sleep disorders, and about 30% of women. However, most of the past research on sleep focused on "sleep apnea", which is temporary hypoxia caused by airway obstruction during sleep. Wang Yiduo pointed out that past studies have shown that patients with sleep apnea are much more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure in the long term, which can even lead to heart failure. Heart failure can almost be said to be "cancer of the heart". Not to be underestimated. It is worth noting that among patients with heart failure, about 20% to 60% do not have sleep apnea, but have unexplained sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleepwalking. Whether sleep disorders, rather than severe sleep apnea, also increase the risk of heart failure. Wang Yiduo said that the research team used the health insurance database to identify a total of 20,985 patients over the age of 20 who were newly diagnosed with sleep disorders in 2000. These people did not have heart failure or sleep apnea, but developed Unexplained sleep disorder. Continuous tracking until 2013 found that a total of 3,498 people suffered from heart failure, a rate of about 17%. On average, 1 in every 6 sleep disorder patients suffered from heart failure. Further analysis found that about 40% of patients suffering from heart failure were younger than 50 years old, and the majority were female. Moreover, 7 years after the sleep disorder was diagnosed, the risk of suffering from heart failure was significantly higher than that of the general population by 20%; in particular, Patients with simple insomnia and inability to fall asleep have a 36% higher risk of heart failure than patients with other sleep disorders. Wang Yiduo speculated that sleep disorders may affect the brain's hormone secretion, which in turn affects the stress center, changes heartbeat and cardiovascular activity, and increases the burden on the heart. Studies in other countries have also found that sleep disorders can increase the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, and can also aggravate the heart. burden, increasing the risk of heart failure, but the detailed mechanism remains to be studied in depth. According to the recommendations of the Taiwan Sleep Medicine Society, if people cannot fall asleep after\nDocument [3]: Dr. Dong: Stress damages health and reduces risk by sleeping 6-8 hours a day | Instant News | Hong Kong and Macao | on.cc Dongwang Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep will increase the risk of coronary heart disease! Those who exercise regularly and have no smoking habits A man suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and fainted while running, and then fell into a coma. He was eventually diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The source was actually related to life stress. A cardiologist said that stress affects people's sleep quality and affects heart health. Too much or too little sleep is equally harmful. The public is reminded to keep a relaxed mood before going to bed and avoid exposure to blue light while surfing the Internet or playing video games. Hong Kong people live a fast-paced life and find it difficult to escape stress. Kwok Miao-fang, an academician of the Hong Kong College of Cardiology, said that Hong Kong people work long hours and have to take care of family, study and other activities after get off work. There is insufficient rest time, and some people even face insomnia. Poor sleep quality will have short-term and long-term consequences. In addition to affecting concentration and mood, it will also increase the risk of chronic diseases in the long term. She pointed out that life stress is one of the factors that affects sleep quality. Cortisol secretion and the sympathetic nervous system will be affected. Stress also causes the immune system to become active, increasing inflammatory cells and factors, which can easily lead to inflammation of blood-related components, and can also cause The viscosity of platelets increases and coagulation factors become active, which accelerates blood coagulation and causes vascular embolism. For example, she once sought treatment from a 59-year-old male patient. He was the owner of a company, but his business was in trouble. He did not smoke and had the habit of running on weekdays. One day, he fainted from a cerebral hemorrhage while running and was once in a coma. After a week of examination, it was found that the male patient's blood pressure had been unstable and he had reactive hypertension. "It went down to 200 (millimeters of mercury) for a while, and he was fine for a while." As many as three blood vessels of the patient were occluded. Later, Coronary heart disease was diagnosed. The patient's blood pressure was controlled only after undergoing coronary intervention surgery, commonly known as "Tongbo Tsai". This case reflects that human stress has a great impact on health. Guo also pointed out that adults should sleep 6 to 8 hours a day. Studies have shown that sleeping less than 5 hours a day increases the risk of coronary heart disease, and is 48% higher than those who sleep 6 to 8 hours. However, you should also pay attention to sleeping too much, because sleeping for more than 9 hours for a long time will increase the chance of coronary heart disease by 38%. ※For the medical and health information you are most concerned about,\nDocument [4]: Ding Rongjing: Research progress in dual-heart medicine - People's Health Network - People's Network Psycho-cardiology, also known as psychological cardiology or behavioral cardiology, is the study and treatment of heart diseases and emotions, social environment and behavior Relevant science. The purpose of dual-heart medicine is not just to treat mental illness and heart disease in one unit, but to emphasize that while paying attention to the patient's physical illness in clinical treatment, we must also pay attention to the patient's mental and psychological state and respect the patient's subjective feelings. , advocates health in the true sense - that is, the comprehensive and harmonious unity of mind and body. The ultimate goal is to improve the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases and achieve complete physical and psychological recovery of patients. Since the concept of double-heart medicine was proposed by Professor Hu Dayi in 1995, it has been undergoing difficult exploration. By accumulating clinical practice experience and making continuous progress, double-heart medicine has made great progress in recent years. The achievements of dual-heart medicine are not only reflected in the progress of scientific research, but also in the improvement of clinicians' understanding of dual-heart problems, the increase in patients' acceptance of psychological problems, the establishment of the dual-heart medical model, and the patients' benefits from the dual-heart medical model. benefits. This article provides a review of the research progress of dual-heart medicine. Depression is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. A 2004 meta-analysis synthesized multiple prospective studies and found that in the general population, after adjusting for other risk factors, it was found that people with depression were 1.5 to 2.0 times more likely to develop coronary heart disease than people without depression; Among patients with coronary heart disease, the risk of long-term cardiovascular events in those with depression is 2.0 to 2.5 times that of those without depression. In 2006, another meta-analysis synthesized 54 observational studies, combined 146 538 participants and 6362 cardiovascular events, and reached the same conclusion. Anxiety is the most common mental and psychological problem in patients with cardiovascular disease, and recent literature shows that anxiety is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Janszky et al. followed 49,321 young Swedish men for 37 years and found that anxiety, as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, can predict the occurrence of coronary events. The relative risks of coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction were 2.17 (95% CI: 1.28 to 3.67) and 2.51 (95% CI: 1.38 to 4.55). Roest et al collected 20 documents on anxiety and the incidence of coronary heart disease between 1980 and 2009, including 249,846 participants, with an average follow-up of 11.2 years. Meta-analysis found that anxiety is independent of other risk factors for coronary heart disease, and the relative risks of coronary heart disease incidence and cardiac death were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.38) and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.92) respectively. The influence of mental and psychological problems in other heart diseases cannot be ignored. The incidence of depression in patients with heart failure is as\nDocument [5]: Sleep disorders are a major problem/20% higher risk of heart failure also affects sexual well-being 2019-03-31 Reporters Wu Liangyi and Lin Huiqin/Special Report Not getting enough sleep or not sleeping well will affect children’s development and academic studies, and adult health will be a red light. Even "sexual" blessings suffer! Insufficient sleep of schoolchildren affects development and learning. Liu Wende, associate professor of the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Peking University Medical University, said that students often sleep less due to heavy schoolwork, and addiction to 3C affects their sleep. They have to go to school early in the morning, and not enough sleep affects them. development, and it is difficult to concentrate, which affects learning performance. A survey conducted by the National Health Service of the Ministry of Health and Welfare found that 76.5% of schoolchildren who slept less than nine hours had a myopia rate, and only 23.5% of those who slept for nine hours had a myopia rate, indicating that sleep may also be related to myopia. The Tri-Service General Hospital has tracked more than 20,000 patients with sleep disorders for 13 years and found that one in six patients has heart failure. Seven years after being diagnosed with sleep disorders, the risk of heart failure is 20% higher than the average person. It is speculated that they cannot sleep well. May affect hormonal secretion. Zhou Kunda, CEO of Taipei Wing-Zhong Sleep Medicine Center, cited sleep apnea as an example. Hypoxia can cause chronic inflammation or activate sympathetic nerves to increase pressure, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and may also lead to male erectile dysfunction. Lin Jiamo, director of the Sleep Center of Shin Kong Hospital, mentioned that he once treated a patient with sleep apnea. After falling asleep, he often breathed through his mouth, which caused infections. He was hospitalized for pneumonia every one or two months. After treatment, it did not happen again. Poor sleep can lead to illness, and diseases may also affect sleep! Zhou Baiqian, director of the Department of Thoracic Medicine at Peking University Medical University, said that a middle-aged woman suffered from allergic rhinitis and was used to sleeping on her stomach. However, sleeping on her stomach oppressed her chest, neck and head, causing her to fall asleep. After breathing through the mouth, the throat gradually swelled and the quality of sleep worsened. After treatment and posture adjustment, the condition improved. A survey conducted by the Taiwan Sleep Medicine Society found that the rate of insomnia among women and middle-aged and elderly people has increased. It is estimated that women may be related to menstrual periods, pregnancy, menopause, or even raising children, while middle-aged and elderly people may be at the peak of their careers or under pressure to retire, or may be under stress. It is caused by disease, and the real cause needs to be clarified. Want to read more news? Welcome to download the Free Times APP. Now you can watch the news and draw prizes.

Many extended family birthday dinners or friends' social gatherings are difficult to implement, leaving many people unhappy. Of course, there are many manifestations of unhappiness, such as feeling depressed, upset, difficulty concentrating, reduced work efficiency, memory loss, reduced learning efficiency, always wanting to cry for some reason, and poor sleep, such as difficulty falling asleep or waking up easily. , nightmares keep waiting. I have introduced exercises to relieve unhappiness before. If you persist in practicing sincerely, you can solve the unhappiness in your heart. This time I introduce a practice method that can improve poor sleep caused by unhappiness. When practicing, do it as slowly, gently and relaxedly as possible: Action requirements: Sit, hold your chest and back, feet shoulder-width apart, place your hands on your thighs, relax your whole body 1. When inhaling, slowly turn your head When exhaling from the left side, slowly turn the head back to the center. 2. When inhaling, slowly turn the head to the right side. When exhaling, slowly turn the head back to the center. Notes: Breathe naturally, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, turn the head every time Let nature take its course, don't force it. If the neck muscles are very tight and the rotation is very inflexible, do not force the twisting, but do it in moderation. Practice for 10 to 15 minutes each time, or go to bed slowly when you feel sleepy. Do not move too much. Think about the problem with positive energy. Why do you need to practice slowly, softly and relaxedly? Because if you do not do it as required, you are prone to dizziness, nervousness, Phenomenon such as poor breathing may actually affect sleep. At the same time, we should pay attention to the fact that "heart diseases require heart medicine." You should try to think about problems with positive energy and avoid thinking about unhappy aspects in everything.

Can you sleep until dawn? Previous literature has confirmed that if you are always "sleepy but not full" or Poor sleep quality will pose a serious threat to cardiovascular health. For example, people are more likely to suffer from coronary heart disease, stroke, or develop atrioventricular fibrillation and arrhythmia, but the detailed cause is still unclear. A report published not long ago in the well-known foreign journal Psychosomatic Medicine pointed out that the spike in blood pressure may be the key. This study was conducted by Caroline Doyle, a scientist in the Department of Psychology at the University of Arizona. She recruited 300 people between the ages of 21 and 70 with no history of heart disease through advertisements. people, and conducted a 2-day follow-up survey on them, with the purpose of exploring whether the quality of sleep affects blood pressure. During the process, everyone needs to wear a blood pressure cuff day and night, and blood pressure values ​​are automatically measured every 45 minutes. In addition, when going to bed at night, you should also wear a wrist actiometer. Generally speaking, after a person falls asleep, their body movements will decrease sharply. The deeper the sleep, the less strength and frequency of activities. If you are a patient with insomnia, you will often toss and turn during sleep, and the amount of activity will be relatively greater. This device contains a kinetic energy detector and photoreceptor, which can record every movement of the human body, and can know the sleep status through software analysis. The results showed that people with low sleep efficiency, that is, people who did not sleep well at night, had significantly higher blood pressure that night and the next day, and this was true for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Researchers say that even just one night of poor sleep can have an impact on the body. Since blood pressure is an important predictor of cardiovascular health, if frequent insomnia causes blood pressure fluctuations, it may contribute to various cardiovascular diseases. If you want to stay away from insomnia, experts recommend developing "sleep rituals", such as taking a bath before going to bed, writing in a diary, doing stretching exercises, etc. If you engage in these activities in the future, your body will know that it is time to go to bed. The second step is to find time to relax, such as practicing yoga and listening to music. You should also have a "good relationship" with your bed, avoid working, scrolling on your phone, or watching TV on the bed, and make the bed a place to sleep. However, if you still have difficulty falling asleep after lying in bed for half an hour, wake up in the middle of the night, or wake up early more than three times a week for up to three months, you should seek medical treatment as soon as possible to avoid further harm.

Attached are 3 dietary treatments that protect the liver and strengthen the spleen. Heart disease ranks third among the most common fatal diseases in Hong Kong, and heart attacks are more likely to occur silently. It turns out that staying up late can also increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and even cancer! What is the relationship between sleep and heart disease? One of the keys to protecting your heart is getting enough sleep? Staying up late not only affects your overall health, but also affects your overall health. Will be sad. (Unsplash/brucemars) Staying up late not only affects your overall health, it can also make you sad. Why does staying up late increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and even sudden death? Here, cardiologist Chen Qiyin explains the issues related to heart health (click on the picture): + 8 + 7 + 6 To protect your heart, you need to sleep well? Sleep is very important for heart health. Not only should you get enough sleep, but you should also have good sleep quality. Cardiologist Chen Qiyin pointed out that human physiological functions are originally designed to adapt to the natural cycle of "circadian rhythms", which is often said to "work at sunrise and breathe at sundown." The hypothalamus (Hypothalamus) of the brain is responsible for adjusting work and rest time, allowing people to adapt to day and night, and releasing fatigue signals to rest. Different previous studies have pointed out that rotating jobs such as medical staff or security guards have a negative impact on the heart or cancer. Not only is the risk of cardiovascular disease higher, but a disrupted biological clock can also affect hormone levels. Are you most likely to have a heart attack when you get up? When you first get up (morning time), different nervous systems will change. For example, the body will prepare to activate the sympathetic nervous system, increase cortisol hormones, increase blood pressure, and increase heart rate, so that you can start a whole day. day activities. Under normal circumstances, the "circadian rhythm" will put a load on the heart. When you wake up in the morning, you are most likely to have a heart attack? (Unsplash/brucemars) Previous studies have found that the following conditions are particularly likely to occur in the morning, including stroke, heart attack, severe arrhythmia or sudden death, especially for people at risk of cardiovascular disease, such as People with high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, such as strokes, heart attacks, and Tongbo surgery. This is precisely because when the body wakes up according to the "circadian rhythm", it activates the sympathetic nervous system, stress hormones, blood pressure, and heartbeat, which will easily cause these adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events to occur. Will staying up all night make you sad? Working all night, including having seizures day and night, working long hours, and working too long a week, will have a bad\nDocument [9]: Survey: 60% of Hong Kong people surveyed have insomnia, mostly due to social events or the epidemic. March 13 is World Sleep Day. The Chinese University of Hong Kong released survey results today (11th) showing that 68% of the people surveyed have insomnia problems, among which About 60% of citizens said that insomnia was affected by social events or the epidemic. Based on reports from Hong Kong 01 and Hong Kong China News Agency, the Communication and Public Opinion Research Center of the Chinese University of Science and Technology conducted random telephone interviews with 807 respondents from February 19 to 25. The survey found that respondents suffered from insomnia for many reasons. In addition to worries about social events and the epidemic, 43% were related to work or academic pressure, 28% were related to health problems, and 20% had family problems. The survey also pointed out that people aged 18 to 39 and men are more likely to suffer from insomnia due to work or academic pressure; people aged 60 or above are more likely to suffer from insomnia due to health problems. When asked whether they would do anything to help them fall asleep when they have insomnia, nearly 40% of the respondents said they would not do anything special or continue to lie in bed, and another 20% said they would play on the phone or use a computer. Eighty percent of citizens said they had not sought medical advice due to insomnia. Psychiatrist Lui Wing-cheung cited the 2014/15 Population Health Survey Report of the Hong Kong Department of Health. At that time, about 48% of the public had insomnia. Compared with the results of this survey, the number of Hong Kong citizens with insomnia has increased significantly. Lei Yongchang said that insomnia may affect cardiovascular health, quality of life, work performance, etc. He advised the public to get up and go to bed at regular times and avoid working or entertaining in bed. If insomnia persists for more than 1 month, you should consider seeing a doctor for evaluation.\nDocument [10]: How many hours of sleep should you get every day if you want to be good for your heart? How many hours of sleep should you get if you want to be good for your heart? 2019-03-02 22:05 Lianhe Daily Reporter Lianhe Daily Reporter Wei Xinxin╱Real-time reporting research points out that sleeping 6 to 6 hours per night Eight hours is best for your heart, while more or less than that may increase your risk of coronary artery disease or stroke. Insufficient sleep and oversleeping should be avoided to achieve optimal heart health. The study analyzed data from 11 studies and more than 1 million adults and found that "short sleepers" had an 11% increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with adults who slept 6 to 8 hours a night. "Long sleepers" had a 33% increased risk over the next nine years. The researchers say that occasional short naps or sleeping in are unlikely to be harmful to health, but evidence suggests that long-term sleep deprivation or long sleep periods should be avoided. Although more research is needed to clarify why short or long sleep is harmful to cardiovascular health, sleep is known to affect physiological processes related to cardiovascular disease such as blood sugar metabolism, blood pressure, and inflammation.\n\nReport:

A person who suffers from chronic insomnia has an increased risk of developing a heart attack or stroke. This is evidenced by a new study by scientists from China Medical University. Sleep is important for human biological recovery and takes up about a third of our lives, but more and more people in the modern world are complaining of insomnia, says Qiao On, a researcher at China Medical University, and gives an example as proof: In one In Germany, a third of the country's total population suffers from symptoms of insomnia. Even earlier, before the study of Chinese scientists, a connection was discovered between insomnia and poor human health. However, this time, scientists for the first time examined and proved the connection between insomnia and diseases of the cardiovascular system. In particular, heart attack and stroke. The authors analyzed the health indicators of 160,867 people who filled out special questionnaires talking about their sleep problems. As a result, significant links were identified between sleep and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. We found that 27 percent of respondents experienced difficulty falling asleep, problems maintaining sleep and, as a result, a lack of restorative nighttime therapy. Another 11 percent suffer from chronic insomnia, which means they have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Another 18 percent are at risk of having a stroke, according to their medical records. Insomnia changes the body's metabolism and endocrine function, increases sympathetic activation, increases blood pressure and the level of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines - and all of this, especially together, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are diseases of the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, hypertension and stroke, peripheral vascular disease, chronic heart failure, angina pectoris and arrhythmia. Every year, 17-18 million people worldwide die from CVDs, primarily from complications of coronary heart disease (CHD). In terms of mortality from coronary heart disease, our country occupies one of the leading places. The study also found that women with insomnia symptoms had a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. However, according to Qiao On, this difference is not so significant: I would not definitively conclude that lack of sleep is more dangerous for women. We know that women are more prone to insomnia due to differences in genetics, sex hormones, increased susceptibility to stress and their (women's) reaction to stressful situations. The study was published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\nDocument [2]: Insomnia increases the risk of arrhythmia and stroke - scientists As you know, this sleep disorder is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, restless sleep and early awakening. Researchers at the University of Michigan found that people with insomnia had a 29% increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared to people without insomnia, Meddaily.ru reports with reference to Zee News. Read alsoThe quality of sleep affects the human psyche. In addition, in patients who complained of frequent awakenings, which create additional stress on the heart, the likelihood of atrial fibrillation was 26% higher than in those who did not wake up often. The risk of arrhythmia was also increased in volunteers with shortened REM sleep. Scientists say insomnia also increased the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart problems. Read also: Doctors warn that anxiety states “kill” the heart. Experts suggest: apparently, sleep disorders negatively affect the autonomic nervous system, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. According to researchers, physical activity and limiting caffeine consumption will help improve sleep quality and prevent arrhythmia.\nDocument [3]: Scientists have found out what disease is caused by frequent awakenings at night. Research was carried out with the participation of almost 13,000 people. Short sleep duration and frequent awakenings at night increase the risk of heart disease. If you are one of those people who sleep little and wake up all night and toss and turn under the covers, then this is sad news for you. Japanese scientists have proven that poor sleep quality, along with its lack, significantly increases the risk of heart attacks. These are the results of a study involving almost 13,000 people. It turned out that people who don't get enough sleep are also half as likely to experience severe angina. We are talking primarily about those who need more than half an hour to fall asleep and who spend less than 6 hours sleeping every night. The study found that such people are 52% more likely to have a heart attack and 48% more likely to have a stroke. Those who sleep less than 6 hours are 24% more likely to have a heart attack. The study authors did not try to find out what explains this connection. However, it can be assumed that poor sleep quality disrupts the processes that our bodies use to carry out essential functions. In particular, frequent awakenings at night negatively affect the sympathetic nervous system, which increases the heart rate and increases blood pressure. The researchers note that the incidence of sleep disorders is approximately one and a half times higher among patients who have a history of strokes and coronary heart disease. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that poor sleep quality leads to cardiovascular disease. It is hoped that if a person can improve the quality of sleep and solve certain problems associated with it, then the risk of heart disease will be reduced.\nDocument [4]: Excess weight - from lack of sleep People suffering from sleep disorders are at risk of obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease, believe the staff of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (USA). Previous studies have shown that people who sleep little are more likely than others to gain excess weight, develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which ultimately ends in premature death. But the current work poses the question differently: the root cause of problems with the heart, blood vessels and metabolism can be, among other things, sleep disorders, that is, difficulties in falling asleep, with sleep itself, as well as excessively long sleep. Scientists analyzed data from 138,201 people to identify links between sleep disturbances and other disorders. The analysis focused on the quality of the subjects' sleep rather than its duration. After demographic, socioeconomic and other risk factors were taken into account, it was found that people who experience sleep disturbances at least three nights a week are, on average, 35% more likely to become obese, 54% more likely to develop diabetes, 98% become victims of coronary heart disease, 80% experience heart attacks, and 102% suffer strokes. This is the largest study to date demonstrating the link between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Therefore, it can be argued that chronic sleep problems entail equally constant illnesses. pronowosti.ru\nDocument [5]: Optimal sleep duration has been calculated According to the American non-profit organization National Sleep Foundation, an adult between the ages of 18 and 65 needs to sleep 7-9 hours a day. Lack of sleep, as well as excess sleep, are considered harmful to the body. It has been shown that they can lead to the development of metabolic syndrome after 40 years, which is characterized by an increase in fat mass in the abdominal area, impaired carbohydrate and fat metabolism, insulin resistance and arterial hypertension. In addition, lack of sleep has also been linked to intrusive, repetitive thoughts, which are commonly seen in anxiety or depression, and is considered a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. A team of scientists led by Epameinondas Fountas from the Onassi Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece, conducted a meta-analysis of eleven prospective studies that looked at the effect of sleep on the development of cardiovascular disease. In total, more than a million adults took part in the study and were free of cardiovascular disease in the past five years. Doctors compared three groups: the first slept for less than six hours, the second for more than eight hours, and the third for six to eight hours. They found that both too little and too much sleep were associated with an increased risk of developing and dying from coronary heart disease or stroke over a mean follow-up period of about 9 years. Compared to the control group, the risk was increased by 11 and 33 percent, respectively. “Our results suggest that too little and too much sleep can be bad for the heart. More research is needed to determine the exact causes, but we do know that sleep influences biological processes, particularly carbohydrate metabolism, blood pressure and inflammation - all of which, in turn, influence the development of cardiovascular disease." concludes Fountas. The main advantage of the meta-analysis conducted by the scientists is that it included only prospective studies in which doctors independently observed a certain group of people (cohort). This avoids memory bias, a systematic error that is caused by differences in the accuracy or completeness of memories of past events. Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death and disability in the world. Within a year of being diagnosed with heart failure, women are more likely to die than men. Research shows that eating eggs daily, walking briskly, and controlling the amount of salt you eat can help reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\nDocument [6]: Insomnia increases the risk of strokes and heart disease - study People suffering from insomnia are often faced with heart disease and strokes. Scientists from China Medical University came to this conclusion after analyzing data from 15 studies involving a total of 160,867 people. The volunteers were followed from 3 years to 29.6 years, says Deccan Chronicle. Read also: Sleep deficiency leads to inflammatory processes Scientists have registered 11,702 adverse events. Experts have found close connections between the symptoms of insomnia and problems with the heart and blood vessels. In particular, difficulty falling asleep increased the risk of strokes and heart disease by 27%, frequent awakenings by 11%, and problems falling asleep after waking up by 18%. Women who suffered from insomnia were slightly more likely to have strokes and heart disease than men with insomnia. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Researchers do not yet know what mechanism is behind the connections found.\nDocument [7]: Lack of sleep turned out to be fraught with deadly consequences (Kazan, August 20, Tatar-inform). Insomnia has been shown to seriously increase the risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke. Researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm came to this conclusion, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the portal of the American Heart Association. Scientists analyzed data from 1.3 million subjects, including both healthy people and people suffering from cardiovascular diseases. In doing so, they used the Mendelian randomization method, which takes into account the genetic factors of insomnia. As a result, experts came to the conclusion that the presence in the body of gene variants that contribute to the development of insomnia leads to an increased likelihood of developing the risk of heart and vascular diseases. Geneticists also paid attention to the scientific work of their predecessors, which noted a connection between sleep disorders and the occurrence of heart failure. At the same time, what is the cause and what is the effect was not stated in previous articles by doctors. “It’s important to identify the root cause of insomnia so you know how to combat it. Sleep is a behavior that can be changed through new habits and stress management,” said lead author of the study, Professor Susanne Larsson. Earlier, Tatar-inform news agency reported that researchers spoke about the consequences of stress at work and lack of sleep.

Don't miss important symptoms Change text size: A A Middle-aged men and women who regularly have trouble sleeping have a 45% higher risk of having a sudden heart attack than those who don't get enough sleep. This conclusion was reached by scientists from the Norwegian University of Natural Sciences and Technology in Trondheim. The study authors linked the risk of myocardial infarction to three main symptoms of insomnia: 1. You wake up several times during the night. Those patients who woke up several times a night for just a month were 30% more likely to have a heart attack over the course of a year. For people who felt sleep deprived in the morning, this risk increased by 27%. The researchers relied on medical records and surveys of more than 52,500 Norwegian adults who answered questions about sleep quantity and quality as part of a national survey. 2. It is difficult for you to fall asleep in the evening. This is a sign of severe nervous tension and the inability to relax. Chronic stress also takes a toll on the heart. In addition, such patients often “dampen” their nerves with alcohol. At first, 50-100 grams of strong drinks help you fall asleep. Then the dose increases, and the result is no longer a normal, but a narcotic sleep. “Knocked out” at night with alcohol, a person, having fallen asleep, begins to experience oxygen starvation of the tissues of the brain and heart, vascular spasms begin, as well as short-term pauses in breathing during sleep (like apnea) . 3. You just can’t swing yourself in the morning, or, on the contrary, you get up too early and can’t fall asleep again (but by lunchtime you feel drowsy). This may indicate two problems - either asthenic depression (simply loss of strength) or vascular insufficiency. Both weaken the heart. The study authors found that more than a third of respondents had at least one symptom of insomnia. “Poor sleep can lead to a heart attack. However, insomnia is a very common problem and can be easily treated. The main thing is not to hush up the problem, but to consult a doctor in time and find the reason why your sleep is disturbed. This will help keep the heart healthy,” said one of the authors of the work, Dr. Lars Erik Laugsand. OPINION OF AN SPECIALIST Tamara Ogieva, cardiologist, doctor of the highest category: - Sleep and the work of the cardiovascular system are much more closely connected than it seems. The hormone melatonin, which is produced only during night sleep, greatly affects the permeability and elasticity of blood vessels. When natural sleep biorhythms are disrupted (when, for example, we don’t sleep at night or go to bed too late), the production of the stress hormone cortisol by the adrenal glands also changes. Its excess in the blood can disrupt the heart rhythm and cause rapid heartbeats. There is an observation that\nDocument [9]: The deadly dangers of lack of sleep have been revealed. The deadly dangers of lack of sleep have been revealed. People suffering from insomnia increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure. This conclusion was reached by Swedish scientists from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The study is summarized in a press release on EurekAlert!. Experts analyzed data on 1.3 million participants. The researchers used the Mendelian randomization method, which takes into account genetic factors for insomnia. This allows us to determine a clearer cause-and-effect relationship between lack of sleep and heart disease. It turns out that having gene variants that contribute to insomnia increases the risk of stroke and other disorders. Insomnia, which affects 30 percent of the world's population, contributes to the development of heart failure, according to previous observational studies. However, this type of study is unable to establish cause and effect, so it was possible that heart problems impair sleep quality.\nDocument [10]: Poor sleep quality in women increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 02/17/2020, 6:29 pm, Miscellaneous Women are especially susceptible to sleep disturbances throughout their lives: in their youth due to childcare responsibilities, and in menopause due to hormonal factors. changes. Sleep problems can affect your health Tweet Scientists from Columbia University Irving Medical Center have suggested that women who sleep poorly are more likely to overeat or consume fatty, carbohydrate-rich foods. The researchers tested their hunch on an ethnically diverse group of 495 women aged 20 to 76 years. When analyzing the subjects' data, sleep quality, time required to fall asleep, and episodes of insomnia were examined. Separately, participants reported their diet over the course of a year. It turned out that women with intermittent poor sleep consumed excess amounts of added sugars in food, and those who had trouble falling asleep or generally suffered from insomnia regularly went over their portion sizes and calories. According to scientists, sleep disturbance provokes failures in the interpretation of satiety and hunger signals in people.

In conclusion, the study authors note that improving sleep quality and eating behavior can reduce the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nReport:

Researchers from the British University of Portsmouth and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory have been able to "optimize" the structure of this natural enzyme in such a way that it can break down said plastic in just a few days. Join the Deutsche Welle Farsi channel on Telegram. The plastic material "PET" is used in plastic water bottles and its recycling is difficult. Professor John McGeehan at the University of Portsmouth, who led the joint research project, said: "We have made a modified version of this enzyme that is better than the natural version that has been available so far." He called the achievement "exciting" because the discovery means the potential ability to optimize enzymes. The PETase enzyme that can eat plastic was discovered a few years ago in Japan. Experts at that time found that this enzyme helps a bacterium break down plastic. In the future, this enzyme can be effective in fighting pollution caused by the accumulation of plastic in the environment; Plastics that remain in the environment for hundreds of years and pollute a large part of the world's soil and water. This research team is now working on further improving this enzyme so that it may be used in the decomposition of plastics on an industrial scale. Professor John McGeehan says the breakthrough may be used in the coming years to break down and sustainably recycle PET as well as other plastics.\nDocument [2]: Rapid decomposition of plastic waste with the help of an engineered enzyme British researchers in their new study were able to engineer an enzyme that can decompose plastic waste at a significant speed. According to ISNA and quoted by Gizmag, in 2018, Japanese scientists discovered a type of bacteria that has a natural appetite for eating plastic. This discovery strengthens the possibility of providing a low-cost solution to combat air pollution. Now scientists have used this bacterium to engineer a super enzyme that can digest plastic waste much faster. This bacterium known as "Ideonella sakaiensis" was discovered two years ago by the scientists of the "Kyoto Institute of Technology" (Kyoto Institute of Technology) and showed a significant ability to use plastics made of "polyethylene terephthalate" (PET) as an energy source. gave This material is used to make many products, including plastic bottles, which are produced in millions of tons every year. Scientists were excited to discover Ideonella sakaiensis because they found that this bacterium could completely degrade polyethylene terephthalate within weeks. Investigations showed that this bacterium performs decomposition work through a pair of enzymes, one of which is called "PETase". Researchers at the University of Portsmouth, England, engineered this enzyme in the laboratory to break down plastic faster. They have now managed to combine this enzyme with its co-enzyme called "MHETase" to increase the speed of plastic digestion. Professor "John McGeehan" (John McGeehan), one of the researchers of this project, said: the initial tests showed that these two enzymes work better together; As a result, we decided to connect them physically. Although it took a lot of time, the result was worth the effort. This new enzyme can break down plastic three times faster than enzymes that work naturally separately, enabling further advances in this field. This super enzyme can digest plastics made of polyethylene terephthalate and be part of the recycling cycle. The speed of natural samples of this enzyme is not enough to decompose the significant amount of plastic waste that is produced annually in the world, but the production of its engineered sample can increase the speed of decomposition and is an important step in this field. end of message\nDocument [3]: Plastic-eating enzyme promises efficient bottle recycling Image copyright David Jones Scientists have enhanced a natural enzyme that can digest some of the most common plastics found in nature. "PET" is a strong plastic material that is used in making bottles and it takes hundreds of years to decompose in the environment. But the modified enzyme called "PTEA" can start breaking down "PTA" in just a few days. This ability could lead to a revolution in the recycling process. In the UK, people use about 13 billion plastic water bottles every year, but only about three billion of them are recycled. This enzyme, which was discovered in Japan, is produced by "eating" bacteria of this type of plastic. "Idionella succincis" uses this plastic as the main source of energy. Researchers reported in 2016 that they found a family of bacteria in sediments left behind at a bottle recycling site in the Japanese port city of Sakai. "PET has only been around for the last 50 years, so it's not a very long time for a bacterium to evolve to digest a synthetic material," says Professor John McGeehan, who was involved in the current study. Polyesters, which are a group of plastic materials to which PET belongs, exist naturally in the environment. Mr McGeehan, who is a professor at the University of Porthmouth, said: "These protect the leaves of trees. Bacteria have evolved over millions of years to eat this material." Photo copyright David Jones Image caption PET is used to produce bottles, however, this bacterium's switch to PET is described as completely unexpected, and it was following this discovery that an international team of scientists sought to identify How the enzyme "PTase" evolved. Eating plastic Researchers with the help of powerful X-ray machines in Oxfordshire, UK, prepared a high-resolution 3D model of this enzyme. They say that once the structure of this enzyme was understood, they were able to improve its performance by manipulating it. Polyesters, which are produced industrially from oil, are widely used in the production of bottles and clothes. In current recycling processes, polyester materials suffer a gradual quality loss, meaning they lose some of their properties every time they are recycled. The bottles are first turned into synthetic wool, then they are produced into machine-made carpet, and then they are sent to the landfill. But the PET corrosive enzyme reverses the production process and turns polyester back into raw materials. "These can be used to make more plastic, which reduces oil consumption ... and the cycle repeats itself. So we have a real recycling," says Professor McGeehan. The researchers say that it will take several years to use this enzyme on a large scale because it has to break down PET faster than the current time, i.e. a few days, in order to be economically viable. "There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and the environment, and I think if we can implement this technology we will have an effective solution to reduce this pollution," says Professor McGeehan.\nDocument [4]: Plastic-eating enzyme designed to fight environmental pollution Scientists in Britain and the United States say they have designed a plastic-eating enzyme that could help fight pollution in the future. This enzyme is able to digest polyethylene terephthalate or PET. This material is a type of plastic registered in the 1940s and currently it is used to make millions of tons of plastic bottles. PET plastics can remain in the environment for hundreds of years and are now contaminating large areas of land and sea around the world. Researchers from the UK's University of Portsmouth and the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory discovered this enzyme while investigating the structure of a natural enzyme evolved at a waste recycling facility in Japan. John McGeehan, a professor at the University of Portsmouth who led the work, said that after realizing that this enzyme helps bacteria break down or digest PET plastic, the scientists decided to manipulate its structure by adding some "amino acids". This action led to a significant change in the activities of the enzyme and made it perform the work of eating plastic more quickly. "So far we've made a modified version of the enzyme that works better than the natural type," McGeehan told Reuters. "It's really exciting because it means it's even possible to optimize the enzyme." The team, whose findings were published Monday in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences, is now working to improve the enzyme and see if it can break down PET plastics on an industrial scale. "In the coming years, we may see an acceptable industrial process for converting PET, and potentially other plastics, back to their original structure so that they can be sustainably recycled," McGeehan said. Independent scientists not directly involved in the research say it's exciting, but caution that the enzyme's development as a potential anti-pollution solution is still in its infancy. "Enzymes are non-toxic and degradable and can be produced in large quantities by microorganisms," said Oliver Jones, an expert in analytical chemistry at the Royal University of Technology in Melbourne. "There is great potential to use enzyme technology to help society's growing waste problem by recycling some common plastics." "More work needs to be done and the enzyme is expected to continue to improve and evolve," said Douglas Kell, professor of biological sciences at the University of Manchester. "Everything points to this progress bringing us closer to the goal of creating recyclable polymers," he added.

Most of the plastics that are produced with the ability to be turned into compost are made of a type of polyester called polylactic acid or PLA, which does not break down during the usual process of turning into compost. As a result, it is often transferred to landfills and remains there. Now researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, put a type of enzyme that feeds on polyester in a special polymer coating in plastic. When this substance was placed in the vicinity of heat and water, the said enzyme was released and decomposed the plastic into its components. In addition, the said enzyme was decomposed under ultraviolet light. In addition to these cases, the plastic containing this enzyme did not produce polluting microplastics during decomposition, so that 98% of it was converted into small molecules.\nDocument [6]: New bacteria that help fight plastic waste Sergey Shakhmatov, executive director of "Green Russia" and deputy of the Krasnoyarsk city council, told Sputnik how the implementation of this idea will help solve the problem of plastic waste. Scientists want to produce an enzyme that destroys polymers, so they analyze the enzyme secreted by a type of willow. This type of willow has the ability to absorb plastic as food. Shakhmatov said: "At the moment, efforts are being made all over the world to create biological organisms that eat plastic. I know for a fact that several Siberian scientists want to create bacteria that destroy certain types of polymers." He added: Of course, having a biological weapon against polymer waste is good. But it is still necessary to focus on maximum recycling of these wastes. The issue of recycling polymers is first of all very important to fight microplastic pollution. It is these microplastics that are the main threat of death to marine life as well as humans today because when we eat fish and seafood they contain tiny plastics.\nDocument [7]: A solution to the problem of plastic waste was discovered. Plastic-eating organisms were discovered. Researchers succeeded in discovering organisms that are able to destroy and eat polyurethane. According to the Scientific Service of the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA) in Kermanshah region, in a report published by Yale University, the researchers of this university succeeded in discovering this organism in the mushrooms of the Amazon rainforest, which can be a new way to get rid of polymeric waste. . Jonathan R. Russell, a student at Yale University, discovered that a family of endophytes secrete an enzyme that destroys polyurethane rubber. This enzyme destroys plastic without needing oxygen, which can be used to destroy buried waste. end of message\nDocument [8]: Self-eating single-use plastic becomes the savior of mankind ISNA/Khorasan Razavi Scientists have created a single-use biodegradable plastic that they say "eats itself". This material is produced in such a way that it contains enzymes that break down after exposure to water and heat. This material could soon be used in things like containers and plastic bags that cover the oceans of the planet. According to News, the researchers of this groundbreaking innovation think that it can also be used in glue so that some common electronic devices can be easily separated from each other and their parts can be reused. They hope that this innovation will mean the end of the life of current disposable plastics and save the environment. Currently, some compostable plastic products do not break down during normal composting, contaminating other recyclable plastics and becoming a problem for recyclers. Therefore, most of these materials, which are mainly made of polyester known as polylactic acid or PLA, are only buried in landfills and remain forever. "People are now ready to move towards degradable polymers for single-use plastics, but if they turn out to be more trouble than they're worth," said Dr. Ting Zhu, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. This mesh may come back. "We are basically saying that we are on the right track and we can solve this persistent problem of single-use plastics that are not biodegradable." The researchers stated: This new material should theoretically be used for other types of polyester plastics and could lead to the creation of compostable plastic containers that are currently made of a type of non-degradable plastic called polyolefin. "Polyolefin plastics can be turned into higher value products instead of compost," said Dr. Zhu. He is now working on ways to convert recycled polyolefin plastics for reuse. The most durable plastics have an almost crystal-like molecular structure and are packed together, so the polymer fibers are strengthened so that water cannot penetrate them, let alone microbes that might chew through the polymers. Zhou's idea was to embed nanoscopic polymer-eating enzymes directly into a plastic or other material; So that it separates them from each other and protects them until the right conditions destroy them. In 2018, he showed how this method is practical. Zhou and his group put the said enzyme in a body, and when the body was immersed in the chemical, this enzyme decomposed the toxic organophosphate. Previously, Dr. Zhou designed molecules called "random heteropolymers" (RHPs) that wrapped around the enzyme and gently held it together without limiting its natural flexibility. These molecules are degraded under UV rays and are present in a concentration of less than one percent of the weight of the plastic, although they are so small that they do not cause problems. In the latest research, he has encapsulated the enzyme in RHPs and embedded billions of nanoparticles throughout plastic resin beads, which are the starting point for plastic production. The group then showed that enzymes coated with RHP did not change the properties of the plastic, and that\nDocument [9]: Decomposition of plastic with cow's stomach microbes! Austrian researchers have stated in their recent study that the microbes in the cow's stomach can destroy plastic. According to ISNA and quoted by STD, breaking down plastic is a very difficult task, but Austrian researchers have found in their recent study that cow rumen bacteria can digest certain types of materials, which can be a sustainable way to reduce plastic litter. Scientists hypothesize that such bacteria are beneficial because cattle's diet already contains plant polyesters. "A large microbial community lives in the rumen and is responsible for digesting food in animals, so we hypothesized that some biological activity could be responsible for the hydrolysis of polyester," said Dr. Doris Ribitsch from the University of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences Vienna. a kind of chemical reaction that leads to decomposition) be used. In other words, these microorganisms can break down similar materials, so the study authors thought they might be able to break down plastics as well. In this study, "Ribitish" and his colleagues examined three types of polyester. The first polyester was polyethylene terephthalate, commonly known as PET. Polyethylene terephthalate is a synthetic polymer commonly used in textiles and packaging. The other two were polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and another bio-based material called polyethylene furanoate (PEF). To conduct the experiment, they took rumen fluids from a slaughterhouse in Austria to test for microorganisms. They then incubated this liquid with three types of plastic (some powdered and some thin) to see how much of the plastic was destroyed. According to their results, all three plastics can be degraded by cow stomach microorganisms, and plastic powders are also degraded faster than thin plastic structures. The findings of this study have been published in the journal "Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology". end of message\nDocument [10]: Digestive fluids of cows have the ability to decompose plastic, according to the report of the University and Education Department of IRNA from Science on Sunday, in this research, the effectiveness of the digestive fluids of the first stomach of cows, which is known as sirabi, and is used in the digestion of natural polyesters as part of the diet of cows , was tested and it was found that the microbial communities in this liquid have the ability to decompose three types of plastics: PET, PBAT and PEF. Normal plastic or PET is used in the packaging industries of various products, fabric production and beverage bottle production. PBAT plastic is a type of biodegradable polymer that is flexible and used to produce various products including plastic bags. PEF plastic is also a type of sustainable plastic that is made using vegetable raw materials and is used for food packaging. Previously, researchers have identified independent microbes that have the ability to break down plastic. But the microbial communities in the cow's stomach consist of different types of microbes, the combination of enzymes produced by them is much more effective than the enzymes produced by an independent microbe. Researchers hope to reduce plastic pollution by using this method. According to the UN report, 300 million tons of plastic waste are produced annually. These wastes have made their way to the deepest parts of the ocean and are now entering the food chain. This situation has led to restrictions on the use of plastic in consumer products, the implementation of huge ocean cleanup projects and efforts to discover new ways to recycle plastic and turn it into new consumer products. According to the report of the Center for Biological Diversity, millions of tons of plastic are found in the place where the water currents of the oceans meet, which make up about 40% of the world's water surface. If this situation continues, by 2050, the weight of this plastic waste will exceed the weight of all the fish in the seas. The full report of this research has been published in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology.\n\nReport:

The deadlines are January 15, 2021, which is 1 Five days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on March 20.\nDocument [9]: Trump orders the withdrawal of most US troops from Somalia (Morning News) The US Department of Defense stated on the 4th that President Trump has ordered the withdrawal of most US military personnel and facilities in Somalia in early 2021. Xinhua News Agency reported that the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement that day that some of the withdrawn U.S. troops will no longer be deployed in eastern Africa, and some of the withdrawn U.S. troops will be deployed to neighboring countries. The U.S. military and partner countries will continue to conduct cross-border military operations against violent extremist organizations in Somalia. Currently, about 700 U.S. troops are stationed in Somalia to train and assist Somali government forces in combating Al-Shabaab militants associated with Al Qaeda. U.S. media quoted U.S. officials as saying that U.S. troops stationed in Somalia will be transferred to military bases in Kenya and Djibouti. The Trump administration has recently accelerated the withdrawal of U.S. troops from overseas. The Pentagon announced on the 17th of last month that the number of US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq would be reduced to approximately 2,500 by mid-January next year. According to reports, there are currently about 4,500 US troops stationed in Afghanistan and 3,000 in Iraq.\nDocument [10]: Only 6 weeks before leaving office, Trump ordered the majority of U.S. troops to withdraw from Somalia - International The U.S. Department of Defense announced today that President Trump ordered the withdrawal of most U.S. troops and security personnel from the African country of Somalia; these troops were originally deployed to combat Islamic radical groups in Somalia. Actions by Al-Shabaab. A U.S. Department of Defense statement stated that Trump "has ordered the Department of Defense and U.S. Africa Command (US Africa Command) to withdraw most personnel and assets from Somalia by early 2021." The U.S. Africa Command has maintained about 700 troops in Somalia, as well as private security contractors, both of which are responsible for combating local al-Shabaab forces and assisting Somalia in training troops. Reuters mentioned that Al-Shabaab is involved with the extremist organization Al-Qaeda. The United States does not pay much attention to the US military's mission in Somalia, but regards it as one of the cornerstones of the Department of Defense's global campaign to suppress Al Qaeda. An anonymous defense official said that after the withdrawal, the remaining US troops will be stationed in the capital Mogadishu. Some experts warn that withdrawing troops from Somalia may seriously affect the country's security. However, the Department of Defense stated that U.S. policy has not changed. "The United States will still retain the ability to conduct targeted counter-terrorism operations in Somalia and collect early warnings and signs of threats to the homeland." Agence France-Presse reports that Trump has recently ordered a massive withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and now has ordered a withdrawal from Somalia, reflecting his continued desire to withdraw the U.S. military from what he calls endless overseas wars and to fulfill his original intention in the final weeks of his term. campaign promises. The outside world is worried about the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops across Africa. The Department of Defense emphasized that the United States "is not withdrawing or abandoning Africa." "We will continue to fight against violent extremist organizations that may threaten our homeland, while ensuring that we maintain our strategic advantage in great power competition." The US military has carried out operations against extremist organizations in Somalia since the early 2000s, mostly with traditional aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Hundreds of people were killed in attacks by drones, which also caused considerable civilian casualties. At the same time, the United States also suffered casualties, including the death of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official at the end of November.

The Associated Press news agency says that the Pentagon's move to withdraw US forces from Somalia is part of Donald Trump's post-election decisions to reduce anti-terrorist military missions in various regions. The Pentagon has announced, without providing details, that the majority of US troops and their equipment will be withdrawn from Somalia in early 2021. It is said that there are about 700 American troops in Somalia, who, in addition to providing the necessary training and consultations to the local forces, are responsible for confronting the Al-Qaeda and Al-Shabaab forces in this region. However, the Pentagon has clarified that the withdrawal of troops from Somalia does not mean the end of US counter-terrorism efforts in the region. According to the US Department of Defense, following this decision, some forces may be given new missions in East Africa. However, the remaining forces from Somalia will be transferred to neighboring countries to enable them to participate in cross-border operations by US forces and their partners against violent extremist organizations in Somalia, the Pentagon added. Last month, after the election, Donald Trump ordered the reduction of the number of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to this order, the number of US troops in Afghanistan should be reduced to 2,500 by January 15 (six weeks from now). Reuters says, considering that the number of American forces is now around 4,500, with the reduction of these forces, there will be unanswered questions about the future of the American military presence in Afghanistan, considering that Joe Biden's administration will take office in less than 50 days. is discussed The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army also announced that the Pentagon has approved the plan to reduce forces in Afghanistan, according to which the United States will continue to maintain two large bases in the country. General Mark Milley said that the U.S. military will continue its two main missions of assisting the Afghan security forces in fighting militants and also conducting counter-terrorist operations against the militants of the Islamic State, ISIS, and al-Qaeda. In 2001, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the United States invaded Afghanistan and overthrew the Taliban government, which had sheltered the Al-Qaeda group. Since then, the US-backed government in Afghanistan has been in power in the country, but the Taliban control large parts of Afghanistan.\nDocument [2]: CNN: The process of withdrawal of American forces in Somalia has begun. According to IRNA's CNN report, General Stephen Townsend, the commander of American forces in Africa, announced in a statement that the activities of the joint task force for the transfer of American forces from Somalia to other I have taken over bases in East Africa. CNN did not mention the number of US troops stationed in Somalia. Donald Trump, who is spending his final days in the White House, ordered the withdrawal of US forces from Somalia by early 2021 in an important military decision earlier this month. In this regard, the Pentagon announced that the President of the United States has ordered the Department of Defense and the United States Africa Command to relocate most of their personnel and assets from Somalia by early 2021. According to the US Department of Defense, the country's soldiers are training internal forces in Somalia to fight Al-Qaeda and Al-Shabaab groups. The withdrawal of US forces in Somalia comes as the White House ordered the reduction of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan last month. Robert O'Brien, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, said that according to this order, the number of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will be reduced to 2,500 by January 25, 2021. O'Brien said the remaining forces will be engaged in protecting the American embassies in Iraq and Afghanistan and other American institutions active in these two countries. The National Security Adviser of the White House added: This is not a new policy, and the President of the United States had announced the number of American forces stationed in these two countries since he started working.\nDocument [3]: After Afghanistan and Iraq, Trump Accelerates Withdrawal of US Forces from Somalia In the last few weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump is trying to fulfill his initial promise to "stop the endless wars". After the recent decisions to speed up the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, Trump announced the withdrawal of most US forces from Somalia in his latest order. Commercial advertisement sequel On Friday, December 4/14, US President Donald Trump ordered that "the majority of US forces be moved out of Somalia by early 2021". He said: "Probably, some of these forces will be stationed somewhere other than East Africa. Another part will go to the neighboring countries of Somalia so that they can keep the pressure on violent extremist organizations." Nearly 700 American special forces are responsible for training and consulting in the Somali army. The US Department of Defense has emphasized that "the United States will not end its commitments in Africa". Since Joe Biden's victory in the US presidential election was confirmed, Donald Trump is trying hard to implement the withdrawal of troops from several countries before the end of his term of office (January 20). In the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, it appears that Donald Trump wants to reduce the number of troops to 2,500 in each country. The withdrawal of US troops from Somalia is also approved by the democratic circles. One of the experts close to Joe Biden said: "Staying in Somalia until there is not a single potential terrorist in this country means that our forces will never be out of Somalia."

According to Sputnik, citing Tasnim, it is noted that according to this order of Donald Trump, most of the American forces will be withdrawn from Somalia by January 15, 2021. He emphasized that Trump asked the Pentagon to maintain a limited establishment in Mogadishu, the capital of this country, at the same time as the withdrawal of most of the American forces from Somalia. Currently, 700 American soldiers are present in Somalia with the alleged aim of helping the Somali forces to defeat Al-Shabaab terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda. The US Department of Defense announced on November 17 that 2,000 US troops would withdraw from Afghanistan and 500 from Iraq.\nDocument [5]: Trump withdraws American troops from Somalia. According to the order of Donald Trump, almost all units of the American army are withdrawn from Somalia. According to the Pentagon's statement, by the beginning of 2021, most of the forces stationed in Somalia are going to leave this country. The Pentagon's statement did not say anything about the current number of US troops stationed in Somalia, but mass media reports about 700 people. The mission of the American forces is to support the Somali government in the fight against the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. This Sunni religious group has been fighting for power in this country for many years and dominates parts of the center and south of the country. Join Deutsche Welle Farsi Channel on Telegram According to the Pentagon, some of the forces may be transferred to other places in Africa and possibly the neighboring countries of Somalia, but no final decision has been made yet. Trump lost the presidential election against Joe Biden in early November this year. He opposes the deployment of American troops abroad, and now, in the last chance he has left in the White House, he is calling them to America. Follow Deutsche Welle Farsi on Instagram In mid-November, Trump ordered the withdrawal of some American troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. The number of people in these units will decrease to about 2,500 people by mid-January 2021; That is, just a few days before Joe Biden enters the White House on January 20th. According to the Wall Street Journal, US troops are to be transferred from Somalia to Kenya and Djibouti. According to the Pentagon, "the United States will continue to be present in the fight against terrorism in Somalia".\nDocument [6]: The US attack on a base of al-Shabaab group in Somalia Al-Jazeera news channel reported on Thursday night that the command center of the American forces in Africa announced that a headquarters affiliated with the al-Shabaab movement near Sako in Somalia was the target of an air strike. The American command in Africa added: In this attack, damage was done to the center belonging to al-Shabaab near Sako. More details about this attack have not been reported. Meanwhile, the CNN news channel reported on December 30: General Stephen Townsend, the commander of US forces in Africa, announced in a statement that the activities of the joint task force of the transfer of US forces from Somalia to other bases I have taken over in East Africa. CNN did not mention the number of US troops stationed in Somalia. In a major military decision earlier this month, Donald Trump, who is in his final days in the White House, ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Somalia by early 2021. Al-Shabaab is a Somali militant group that has made an alliance with Al-Qaeda terrorists since 2012. In the past, this group controlled parts of central and southern Somalia, but in 2015, it lost major cities and only occupied a few rural areas in Somalia. Al-Shabaab has repeatedly attacked government troops and peacekeeping forces of the African Union in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and has carried out several bloody operations in other parts of Africa.\nDocument [7]: Trump has ordered the withdrawal of US forces from Somalia. According to IRNA, the Wall Street Journal quoted US officials as saying that the order for the withdrawal of US forces from Somalia has been issued while they have been in the country for 13 years to fight against forces affiliated with Al-Qaeda and Al-Shabaab were present. According to this report, approximately 700 US troops stationed in Somalia will be transferred to bases in Kenya and Djibouti, and only one group will remain in Somalia to carry out smaller counter-terrorism missions against al-Shabaab and Islamic State militants. US troops are expected to leave the country by early next year, officials said. According to the Wall Street Journal, unlike the former head of the Pentagon, this decision is supported by Chris Miller, acting secretary of defense. The withdrawal of most US forces in Somalia comes as the White House ordered the reduction of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan last month. Robert O'Brien, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, said that according to this order, the number of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will be reduced to 2,500 by January 25, 2021. O'Brien said the remaining forces will be engaged in protecting the American embassies in Iraq and Afghanistan and other American institutions active in these two countries. The National Security Adviser of the White House added: This is not a new policy, and the President of the United States had announced the desired number of American forces stationed in these two countries since he started his job.\nDocument [8]: Trump ordered the withdrawal of American forces from Somalia 57 minutes ago, the US Ministry of Defense announced this news yesterday and said that the majority of forces will be withdrawn from Somalia in early 2021. According to Reuters, the US Department of Defense has not specified how many US troops will leave Somalia. The United States has about 700 soldiers in Somalia who are conducting operations against the al-Shabaab militant group in this country. This is despite the fact that Trump has already ordered the reduction of American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nDocument [9]: Critical reactions of Somali officials to the withdrawal of American troops from the country Critical reactions of Somali officials to the withdrawal of American troops from the country Image source, Getty Images Image caption An unspecified number of American troops will be transferred to neighboring countries of Somalia to carry out border missions Donald Trump's decision The President of the United States has faced a critical reaction from the country's authorities for withdrawing almost all of the country's forces from Somalia by January 15 next year (2021). Ayoub Ismail, one of the senators of Somalia, said that this decision is really regrettable considering that the presence of 700 American troops had an important impact on the training of the soldiers of this country. Colonel Ahmad Abdullahi Sheikh, one of the former commanders of Somalia, has warned that the withdrawal of American forces will have a profound effect on the efforts to deal with the Islamist militias of al-Shabaab and the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in this region. The US Ministry of Defense has said that some of its forces have been transferred to Somalia's neighboring countries and will be allowed to carry out border operations. In recent months, Mr. Trump issued similar orders to reduce American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has long called for the return of American soldiers and has criticized American military interventions for their high cost and ineffectiveness. The order to return American troops from different countries was made while there are only a few weeks left until the end of Mr. Trump's presidency. The withdrawal of US troops from Somalia is contrary to the policy of former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by Mr. Trump last month. Mr. Esper wanted to maintain the position and presence of American forces in Somalia. Some experts have warned that the withdrawal of American forces could embolden the militants in the Horn of Africa region. Last month, US government inspectors made recommendations regarding the withdrawal of US troops from Somalia. According to them, the local forces are not able to deal with the threats of the militants without the military support of the United States. Image source: Getty Images Image caption America is reducing its forces in Iraq and Afghanistan The Pentagon said that those American forces that remain in Somalia will be stationed in Mogadishu, the capital. Somalia has been politically unstable for decades, but in recent years peacekeepers from the African Union along with US forces have been able to take back control of Mogadishu and other areas from al-Shabaab militias affiliated with al-Qaeda.

However, due to the generous support policies provided by the government, attracting capital from all parties to invest, the current public production capacity of new energy vehicles in the mainland is planned to exceed 20 million units, reaching the official development target for 2020. ten times, facing a serious overcapacity crisis. Because the development of the new energy automobile industry can not only alleviate the energy and environmental protection pressures China currently faces, but also cultivate new economic growth points and promote China's transformation from a traditional automobile power to a modern automobile power. Therefore, in "Made in China 2025", new energy vehicles are listed as one of the ten key development industries. Under the active encouragement and promotion of the government, mainland China's new energy vehicle industry has grown rapidly in the past few years. In 2017, mainland China's new energy vehicle production and sales reached 794,000 and 777,000 respectively, with growth rates of 53.8% and 53.3%, ranking first in the world for the third consecutive year. Currently, more than half of the new energy vehicles in use around the world are in China. However, Xinhua News Agency's "Looking" magazine warned in the latest issue of the stalled development of new energy vehicles in mainland China. According to reports, since 2001, mainland officials have launched a series of policies to support the development of new energy vehicles, including subsidies for enterprises and consumers, technology research and development support, and tax incentives. In particular, government financial subsidies are the largest driver of new energy vehicle consumption. Source power. In addition to central government subsidies, many local governments provide supporting subsidies for new energy vehicles at a 1:1 ratio. The total subsidies of the two levels of government often reach 60,000 to 100,000 yuan (approximately NT$270,000 to 450,000 NT dollars). Some Small electric vehicles therefore become "zero cost" or even "negative cost". The article stated that due to the temptation of high subsidies, a large number of companies overproduced according to actual market demand, and attracted a flood of capital from various sources into the field of new energy vehicles, setting off a nationwide "car-making movement." In addition to traditional car manufacturers, they have announced "geometric" production and sales growth plans. For example, BAIC New Energy plans to achieve annual production and sales of 500,000 vehicles by 2020, and BYD plans to invest RMB 15 billion to achieve a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles by 2020. A number of emerging Internet companies have also entered the new energy vehicle market, including: LeTV Automobile, NIO, Chehejia, JD.com, Tencent, etc. Even some leading companies in other industries have invested in new energy vehicle manufacturing, such as Gree Group, Wuliangye\nDocument [2]: Schroders Investment Management: China's electric vehicle attractiveness has increased sharply. Following the decline in sales in 2019 and the impact of the epidemic in early 2020, China's electric vehicle market is recovering strongly, mainly due to more attractive models and more competitive costs. , sales growth accelerated as a result. In addition, the government's new guidance policies provide strong support for the electrification of China's automotive industry. Currently, most automakers are selling electric vehicles without making a profit, but China's new policies represent a blueprint for transforming the industry and are expected to boost sales after two years of stagnation. In addition to the government's strong policy support, there are three trends that are making China's electric vehicles more attractive. First, the price of electric vehicles has dropped and their range has improved. Chinese consumers have three major concerns about electric vehicles: high price, limited range and insufficient charging stations. Since 2014, battery costs have fallen by more than 70%, narrowing the price gap between electric vehicles and traditional gasoline vehicles. We estimate that the current cost difference between traditional internal combustion engine power systems and expensive battery power systems is only about 30,000 yuan (about 4,500 US dollars). Whether it is an electric vehicle or an internal combustion engine vehicle, the powertrain is the most expensive part of any vehicle. Therefore, if battery costs continue to fall by single-digit percentages each year, electric vehicle prices should be on par with internal combustion engine vehicles within five years. At the same time, the efficiency and endurance of electric batteries have also been improved. Taking the best-selling electric vehicle brands as an example, the range has now reached 300 to 700 kilometers, which is on par with internal combustion engine vehicles. Second, new models become industry disruptors. New electric vehicle models are being launched on the market, and traditional car manufacturers are also participating. In addition to intensifying competition among brands, consumers also have more choices. Since large automakers have the power to negotiate prices with suppliers, costs are expected to fall and more price-competitive products will be introduced in the future, which will promote the popularity of electric vehicles. Third, automobile intelligence. Chinese consumers are deeply influenced by the smart technology provided by electric vehicles (i.e., "car intelligence"). In addition, the price of electric vehicles is expected to be in line with traditional vehicles in the next five years. This trend may make the market clearly tilted in favor of electric vehicles. party. Although industry trends are exciting, the Chinese government's policy support is still critical to the accelerated development of the electric vehicle industry. However, the nature of this support is changing. As battery costs fall and efficiency improves, direct price subsidies are being phased out. On the contrary, the "New Energy Vehicle Development Plan (2021-2031)" and the "Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap 2.0" released by the government in October are both aimed at supporting the construction of charging infrastructure. There are several groups involved in the charging infrastructure market, including the state-owned State Grid Corporation of China,\nDocument [3]: What tests will China’s new policies face as it develops its electric vehicle market? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is both the world’s largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile market. Outside China, few car owners have heard of BYD or Beijing Automobile Works. But in the field of electric vehicles, these two brands already occupy the first and second spots in the world. For a decade, the Chinese government has used subsidies and other policies to spur consumers and manufacturers to flood the electric vehicle market. Data shows the strategy is working: China buys more than half of the world's new electric cars, according to the International Energy Agency. Now, the Chinese government plans to put more pressure on automakers through a new "emissions trading" system that will make it more difficult for manufacturers to open factories to make gasoline-powered vehicles. These new regulations are believed to have come into effect on January 1 this year. The small but rapidly growing Chinese market China is both the world's largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile market. However, after 20 years of rapid growth, China's automobile sales recorded 22.7 million units in 2018, a decrease of 6%. The latest data shows that new energy vehicles (NEVs), including electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, have experienced substantial growth in the past year, contrary to the overall trend of China's automobile industry. However, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) stated that in the first three quarters of 2018, a total of 601,000 new energy vehicles were sold in China, which only accounts for a small part of the Chinese automobile market. How do the new regulations work? China's National Development and Reform Commission stated that it prohibits the establishment of new independent fuel vehicle companies and also introduced many additional conditions for companies that have plans to build new non-new energy vehicle production plants. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China has been actively promoting the development of new energy vehicles, both to reduce air pollution and to support the development of the industry. New quotas for electric vehicles will also have an impact on automakers. Under the new "emissions trading" system, any company that produces 30,000 cars or more needs to accumulate points worth 10% of its output. In other words, if a car manufacturer produces 30,000 vehicles, its points need to reach 3,000. But not all cars are held to the same standards. Producing a new energy vehicle can earn 2-6 points, depending on the distance it can travel on a single charge. So, if a car manufacturer produces 30,000 cars, the company can meet its required quota by building 1,000 cars earning 3 points each. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla's Gigafactory has just started construction on the outskirts of Shanghai. All companies that fall short of their quotas will face fines, but companies that do not meet the quota can purchase credits from companies with surpluses. In other words, manufacturers that have not reached the quota can directly subsidize manufacturers that have reached the quota.

New energy vehicles are being sold in many locations in ASEAN and Guangxi. 2019-05-24 03:58 Lianhe Daily Mainland News Center/Comprehensive Report Guigang City, Guangxi, which has never produced a single tire, has grown rapidly in recent years. New energy vehicle companies are vying to settle in and are committed to building Guangxi's second automobile production base. China News Service reported that new energy vehicles are the future development trend of the automobile industry. As the only province in China connected to ASEAN by sea and land, Guangxi looks to the ASEAN market and regards new energy vehicles as a key development industry, accelerating the cultivation and development of the new energy vehicle industry, and seeking "Overtaking in corners". The "Guangxi Industrial High-Quality Development Action Plan (2018-2020)" proposes to accelerate the application and promotion of new energy vehicles and accelerate the development of Liuzhou, Nanning, Guigang, Guilin and other places into domestic leading new energy vehicle R&D and manufacturing bases. By 2020, the total output value will be 30 billion yuan. As one of China's automobile cities, Liuzhou is home to many vehicle manufacturers such as SAIC-GM-Wuling, Dongfeng Liuzhou Automobile, FAW Liute, SINOTRUK Transport Capacity, and Yanlong Motors. Liuzhou has already taken steps in the research and development, production and promotion of new energy vehicles. In 2017, SAIC-GM-Wuling launched the Baojun series of new energy vehicles, with sales currently exceeding 50,000 units. In addition, in the Emerging Industrial Park in Yongning District, Nanning City, a new energy vehicle production base project with an investment of 3 billion yuan from Shanghai Sunlong Bus Co., Ltd. is under construction. In April this year, the Guilin BYD New Energy Commercial Vehicle Industry Base with an investment of 2 billion yuan was officially completed and put into production. The base plans to produce 1,000 pure electric buses annually and strives to achieve an annual output value target of 2 billion yuan. At present, China's new energy vehicle industry is in the ascendant, and major companies are competing for the commanding heights of new energy vehicle manufacturing. To this end, Guangxi officials have successively issued supporting policies such as the "Action Plan for the Development of New Energy Vehicles" and the "Interim Measures for the Construction, Operation and Management of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure", and also "replaced subsidies with rewards" to stimulate purchasing power. In order to promote new energy vehicles and solve user pain points such as mileage anxiety and charging troubles, Guangxi officials issued a new policy in January this year to provide policy convenience for the use of new energy vehicles in terms of parking, charging, electricity prices, right of way and other aspects.\nDocument [5]: Developing a green and low-carbon economy: What has China done specifically? In order to balance economic development and respond to climate change, China is vigorously developing a green and low-carbon economy. In September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a commitment at the United Nations General Assembly: China will increase its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), adopt more powerful policies and measures, strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030, and strive to achieve a peak by 2060. Become carbon neutral. Subsequently, South Korea and Japan successively pledged to enter a "zero-carbon society" by 2050. Carbon neutrality means that the amount of greenhouse gases directly or indirectly produced by an enterprise, group or individual within a certain period of time is equal to the amount of greenhouse gases eliminated directly or indirectly through afforestation, etc., that is, the net emission of greenhouse gases is zero. The "2019 Emissions Gap Report" released by the United Nations (UN) Environment Program shows that global efforts to reduce emissions have basically failed. The long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, and to try to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, the global average temperature has already risen compared with pre-industrial levels. 1.1 degrees Celsius, global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising year by year and have not yet reached their peak. On April 22, 2016, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli attended the high-level signing ceremony of the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and signed the Paris Agreement on behalf of China. (Xinhua News Agency) To prevent temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius, total global greenhouse gas emissions must remain below 24 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by the end of this century. However, at present, this goal seems to be far away. In 2018, global greenhouse gas emissions reached 37.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and are still rising. Currently, China is the world's largest carbon emitter, accounting for more than a quarter of global carbon emissions. Therefore, China's participation is crucial to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. As a developing country, China needs to sacrifice a certain amount of economic growth in order to cope with climate change, but for the well-being of all mankind, China must make a choice. On September 3, 2009, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao promised to reduce the carbon emission coefficient in China's economic growth process when China's per capita carbon emissions were far lower than those of the United States and even lower than those of the European Union. This became China's green and low-carbon development strategy. The beginning of the economy. The Chinese government has always been very active. In the "Twelfth Five-Year Plan" (2011-2015), the energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) will be reduced by 16% by 2015 compared with 2010; in the "13th Five-Year Plan" (2011-2015) The Five (2016-2020) plan requires that energy consumption per unit of GDP will drop\nDocument [6]: China's June car sales fell 12.4% year-on-year as chip shortages affected production. According to a report by Reuters on Friday, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) announced the number of car sales in June 2021 on the 9th, with the figure reported at 2.02 million. vehicles, an annual decrease of 12.4%. The global shortage of semiconductors has caused a slump in automobile production. In the first half of 2021, the total sales volume of China's automobile market was reported at 12.89 million vehicles, an annual increase of 25.6%. Senior officials from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in an online meeting that although automobile production in June this year was affected by the global semiconductor shortage, due to the recovery of the overall economy, they are also optimistic about the future development of China's domestic automobile market to a certain extent. Have an optimistic attitude. In terms of new energy vehicles including electric vehicles, plug-in gasoline-electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles, the number of sales units in June 2021 was reported at 256,000 units, an annual increase of 139.3%. In order to improve the air pollution problem, the Chinese government is actively promoting the popularization of low-pollution cars. Shanghai NIO (NIO-US), Xpeng Motors (XPEV-US), BYD (1211-HK) and other automobile manufacturers are also promoting the Expand the production capacity of new energy vehicles. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said last month that they predict that the full-year sales performance of new energy vehicles will grow by more than 40% in the next five years. In addition, Tesla of the United States (TSLA-US), which has set up a factory in Shanghai, China to produce electric vehicles and has attracted much attention for its sales trends, reported sales in the Chinese market of 33,155 vehicles in June 2021.\nDocument [7]: The electric vehicle boom will shift from China to Europe - Finance Tesla reported that it has made profits for three consecutive quarters, and electric vehicles have become the next protagonist of the automobile industry. Fubon Securities said that global car sales fell by 5% last year due to the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and the slowdown in China's economic growth, but electric vehicle sales bucked the trend and grew by 10%. As the electric vehicle heat wave shifts from China to Europe, it will help Regarding the overall development of electric vehicles, it is an industry worthy of investors' continued attention. According to statistics from the Industrial Research Institute, global automobile sales fell to 90.6 million units in 2019, a decrease of about 5% from 95 million units in 2018, and far lower than the record 96.8 million units in 2017. Among the many markets, the Chinese market, which is the fastest growing in the world, has the greatest impact. Last year, China’s car sales were only 25.8 million units, a decrease of 8% from the previous year. It has been in decline for the second consecutive year. The second largest US market also declined slightly, barely maintaining an annual sales of 1,700 units. Thousands of vehicles. With the gradual saturation of China's automobile market and the popularity of rent-and-return car sharing, it is expected that the sales growth of the automobile market will remain stagnant in the future. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, it is estimated that global electric vehicle sales will reach 22 million units in 2030, more than 10 times the current market size. The main highlight of the automotive industry in the next few years will come from electric vehicles that meet the environmental protection needs of the new generation. China has been the world's largest electric vehicle market for several consecutive years. In 2019, China's electric vehicle sales reached 1.2 million, accounting for more than 50% of the global market. However, it fell 4% from 2018, mainly because the Chinese government began to reduce sales in the second half of last year. Car purchase subsidies for electric vehicles caused a sharp decline in sales in the second half of last year. However, at the beginning of this year, in order to stabilize the confidence of the electric vehicle supply chain, the Chinese government stated that it would no longer cut subsidies, and it is expected to return to positive growth this year. In addition, after the US-China trade war, the Chinese government has canceled the electric vehicle whitelist system in order to eliminate the industrial subsidy policy criticized by foreign manufacturers. Therefore, it is expected that it will be beneficial for foreign electric vehicle manufacturers to enter the Chinese market. Fubon Securities said that taking Tesla as an example, through subsidies from the Chinese government, the Shanghai factory successfully started mass production at the end of last year and successfully put Model 3 into production. Tesla has even given back the Chinese government’s car purchase subsidies to consumers and made\nDocument [8]: What tests will China’s new policies face as it develops its electric vehicle market? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is both the world’s largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile market. Outside China, few car owners have heard of BYD or Beijing Automobile Works. But in the field of electric vehicles, these two brands already occupy the first and second spots in the world. For a decade, the Chinese government has used subsidies and other policies to spur consumers and manufacturers to flood the electric vehicle market. Data shows the strategy is working: China buys more than half of the world's new electric cars, according to the International Energy Agency. Now, the Chinese government plans to put more pressure on automakers through a new "emissions trading" system that will make it more difficult for manufacturers to open factories to make gasoline-powered vehicles. These new regulations are believed to have come into effect on January 1 this year. The small but rapidly growing Chinese market China is both the world's largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile market. However, after 20 years of rapid growth, China's automobile sales recorded 22.7 million units in 2018, a decrease of 6%. The latest data shows that new energy vehicles (NEVs), including electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, have experienced substantial growth in the past year, contrary to the overall trend of China's automobile industry. However, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) stated that in the first three quarters of 2018, a total of 601,000 new energy vehicles were sold in China, which only accounts for a small part of the Chinese automobile market. How do the new regulations work? China's National Development and Reform Commission stated that it prohibits the establishment of new independent fuel vehicle companies and also introduced many additional conditions for companies that have plans to build new non-new energy vehicle production plants. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China has been actively promoting the development of new energy vehicles, both to reduce air pollution and to support the development of the industry. New quotas for electric vehicles will also have an impact on automakers. Under the new "emissions trading" system, any company that produces 30,000 cars or more needs to accumulate points worth 10% of its output. In other words, if a car manufacturer produces 30,000 vehicles, its points need to reach 3,000. But not all cars adopt the same set of standards. Producing a new energy vehicle can earn 2-6 points, depending on the distance it can travel on a single charge. So, if a car manufacturer produces 30,000 cars, the company can meet its required quota by building 1,000 cars earning 3 points each. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla's Gigafactory has just started construction on the outskirts of Shanghai. All companies that fall short of their quotas will face fines, but companies that do not meet the quota can purchase credits from companies with surpluses. In other words, manufacturers that have not reached the quota can directly subsidize manufacturers that have reached the quota. Analysts say\nDocument [9]: The concept of new energy has set off three major changes in the automobile industry. In October, the State Council of China passed a development plan for the new energy automobile industry, requiring that from 2021, newly added buses, taxis, logistics distribution and other vehicles in designated green ecological areas will be public domain vehicles. , the proportion of new energy vehicles cannot be less than 80%. In addition, the plan also points out four major points for the development of new energy vehicles: first: strengthening innovation in core technologies, such as vehicle operating systems, power batteries and other fields; second: strengthening infrastructure construction such as charging, battery swapping, and hydrogen stations; Third: Strengthen the new energy vehicle industry and international cooperation; Fourth: Support the proportion of new energy vehicles used in the public service system. Not only is the Chinese government strengthening guidance for new energy vehicles, many European countries have also set clear development goals for new energy vehicles, such as Germany increasing subsidies for new energy vehicles. Under the stimulus policies of European countries, sales of new energy vehicles in Europe have begun to increase. New energy vehicles, with rising environmental awareness and government support, have caused changes in the century-old automobile industry. Change 1: The rise of new forces such as Tesla, and the expansion of technology leaders such as Internet and semiconductors in the automotive industry, leading to the reshaping of the competitive landscape of the automotive industry and the reconstruction of the core value chain. From the perspective of pattern reshaping, new energy vehicle manufacturers led by Tesla have sprung up, each using their own R&D advantages and Internet genes to continuously seize the market share of the traditional automobile industry. As for the reconstruction of the value chain, the core value of the future automobile industry will no longer be engines, bodies, chassis, etc., but batteries, chips, central systems, big data, etc. Facing the trend of electronics, traditional car manufacturers immediately responded. Volkswagen announced the establishment of a Digital Car & Service department to fully promote digital transformation. Toyota has switched its competitors from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen to Apple, Google, etc. As for major technology companies such as Google, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, etc., they have also entered the smart driving field through cooperation, authorization, or as suppliers, and have the opportunity to occupy the leading position in related industries in the future. Change 2: At present, governments in Europe, Japan, South Korea and other countries are accelerating the transformation of the automobile industry towards electrification. Although China began to focus on this field ten years ago, these countries are latecomers. For example, in April 2019, the European Union announced the strictest carbon emission standards in history. Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Portugal set a ban on the sale of traditional fuel vehicles between 2025 and 2040. The development of new energy vehicles has become the only way out for the automobile industry.

According to Isna, electric and electric cars have received a unique reception from users these days, now it seems that in some countries such as China and also Scandinavian countries, more customers in China are clean and environmentally friendly cars than in Other parts of the world have welcomed. Many countries in the world are planning to mass produce all-electric cars with the aim of dealing with air pollution and reducing the amount of emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases and protecting the environment. Therefore, many automobile companies in the world have decided to mass produce electric cars and have unveiled their plans for this purpose. The ever-increasing increase in electric cars and the popularity of more use of these clean cars has caused automobile companies around the world to face a tight competition and each of them unveil their plans to design and produce better cars with more navigation power. According to the latest statistics and reports published on the driven website, the sales of electric and electric cars in the first half of 2018 has seen an 80% increase compared to the same period last year, which is an unprecedented record. Nazir is an example for the production industry and sales markets of clean and environmentally friendly vehicles. Many governments such as England, France, Norway, Spain, Greece, Mexico, China and India are among the pioneers who plan to produce and sell gasoline and diesel cars until the 2030s and finally in order to prevent air pollution and preserve the environment. The 2040s (about the next two decades) should be banned and stopped. end of message\nDocument [2]: Dealing with air pollution and the determination of Asians to use electric cars, according to IRNA, the decrease in oil reserves in the world and the increase in energy prices have prompted governments and car manufacturers in different countries to move towards reducing fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. The production of electric cars is progressing. The low consumption, low cost of maintaining and using electric cars, reducing the amount of pollution and preserving the environment caused automobile companies around the world to compete closely with each other for the production of these types of cars. Statistics show that the world's automotive industry has seen huge transformations in the field of "electric cars" in the last decade, and a very clear perspective can be drawn for the development of this specific type of cars, especially in Asia. According to experts, it seems that these cars can replace internal combustion cars in the coming decades. This is despite the fact that Iranian car manufacturers have not taken any serious and significant activities in this field. Changing the global approach: According to experts, the approach of most automotive companies in Asia-Pacific has changed and they are moving towards the construction and design of electric, electric and hybrid cars. The latest reports on the sale of electric cars in the world show that Asian countries have taken the first place in the field of buying electric cars compared to American and European countries. Statistics show that the annual growth rate of electric cars in Asia is about 55%. While this figure is estimated at 32% and 26% in America and Europe, respectively. Currently, most of the European, American and Asian governments, including China and India, plan to produce and sell gasoline and diesel cars until the 2030s and finally until the 2040s in order to prevent air pollution and protect the environment (almost two decades). future) prohibited or completely stopped. Also, most Asia-Pacific countries, such as China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, have eliminated sales tax or given discounts to this issue with the aim of creating culture and encouraging people to buy electric cars. This issue has caused car dealers to be more willing to sell electric cars compared to diesel cars. China, the leader in sales: Among Asian countries, the sale of electric cars in the Chinese market has taken a significant share. According to the Japanese news site Niki, in 2020, at least 1,300,000 electric cars were sold in China, which is an 8% increase compared to the same period last year. It is also predicted that the sales of electric cars in China will increase by 40% in 2021 to 1.8 million units. According to the Hong Kong news site "South China Morning Post", one of the most important reasons for the popularity of electric car sales in China; The government of this country has supported the sale of such cars. Currently, the Chinese government has adopted some solutions with the aim of increasing the sale of electric cars, one of which is subsidizing the sellers of these cars. According to the announcement\nDocument [3]: In which continent is the electric car market growing the most? The electric car sales market in some countries of the world has grown much more than other countries. According to ISNA, many countries of the world are planning to replace gasoline and diesel cars with all-electric cars in order to deal with air pollution and reduce the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases, as well as to protect the environment more. Play themselves in the development of infrastructure related to clean and environmentally friendly means of transportation. According to a report on the cleantechnica website, experts and analysts active in the car market, by reviewing and analyzing the statistics and figures related to the sale of electric cars in different countries of the world, have found that since 2015, the annual growth of the market of these vehicles In the world, 41% has been reported and announced. According to Kevin Rook, one of these experts, 41% is a very large and significant figure for the growth of the electric car market, which includes all-electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid. In the continuation of his speech, he has also pointed to the stunning statistics of the sale of electric cars in Asian countries and noted that the Chinese market has taken a significant share of these statistics and figures. In this report, the growth rate of the electric vehicle market by three different continents of Asia, Europe and America is mentioned and announced as follows: Annual growth of electric vehicles in Asia: 55% Annual growth of electric vehicles in America: 32% annual growth of electric vehicles Electric in Europe: 26% As it is clear from the numbers mentioned above, it can be concluded that contrary to public opinion and very extensive advertisements to encourage citizens to buy and use electric cars in Europe and America, Asia is still the first place in The growth of the market of clean and environmentally friendly cars has taken its place. Explaining the reasons and motivations of Asian citizens for more acceptance of electric cars, these analysts say: There are several important and influential reasons, one of which is undoubtedly the high population of Asian countries such as China and India, which creates the imbalance in the comparison. he does. Another important reason is the existence of a large number of domestic and foreign automobile companies in Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and India. On the other hand, there are many factories in other Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam, which supply the parts needed by automobile manufacturers at lower and more affordable costs than in other parts of the world. The ever-increasing increase in electric cars and the popularity of more use of these clean cars has caused automobile companies around the world to face a tight competition and each of them unveil their plans to design and produce better cars with more navigation power. In this way, major automobile companies have decided to change their approach and go towards the construction and design of electric and electric and hybrid\nDocument [4]: China allocates subsidies for the sale of electric cars. The South China newspaper reported on Friday that after the corona epidemic, the sale of cars, including electric cars, in China has decreased greatly, and Beijing is looking for subsidies to get out of this crisis. This subsidy may not be available to all companies based on the announced plan, including that it will not include Tesla, the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in China. The Ministry of Finance of China had previously considered such subsidies for the manufacturers of these cars, which will expire by the end of the year and will be extended for another two years. In order to be the leader of other countries in this industry and to reduce the amount of pollution in cities, China has allocated billions of dollars in subsidies to the production of electric cars. Since the middle of 2009, some of the concessions of the manufacturers of these cars were canceled and the amount of subsidies was slightly reduced, which caused a noticeable drop in sales, and after the spread of Corona, the situation for these factories has worsened. As the epidemic intensified in China, sales fell to the point that sales of electric cars in China fell by 50 percent in the first three months of this year, and some factories were closed. Now China has decided to revive this industry once again by reducing taxes on these companies and increasing subsidies. These subsidies will be for companies whose finished cars are not worth more than 42,500 dollars, so it does not include the Tesla Model 3, which has a price of 45,800 dollars. Tesla, which produces its cars in the city of Shanghai, China, is the first company that has succeeded in having its own shares and sometimes has cooperation with Chinese partners.\nDocument [5]: Why the Iranian electric car is not commercialized/Battery and numbering channel of Knowledge and Technology Group - Mehr News Agency; Masoumeh Bakshipour: With the increasing use of cars in various industries, the need for energy sources to move them is strongly felt, and currently fossil fuels are the most important sources of energy to move cars. This is while due to the exhaustion of these resources in the coming years as well as environmental issues such as the emission of greenhouse gases, today various industries are looking for alternatives to energy supply sources with new technologies. Since the transportation industry is one of the most important fuel-consuming industries, the replacement of electric vehicles and electric motors with internal combustion vehicles is on the agenda of countries. Rechargeable electric cars are one of the best candidates for replacing fossil fuel-based cars due to their low pollution and high efficiency, and for this reason, we see amazing developments in the battery industry and charging facilities for these cars from countries. Countries around the world are moving towards the electrification of cars, and even in some European countries, a period of time has been set to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars. This is while the examination of the current situation of electric cars and the necessary infrastructure for their charging in Iran shows that until now no effective action has been taken by the country's automobile industry in line with academic research measures, and academic studies and research have not reached the commercialization stage. Now, considering the acquisition of technical knowledge for the production of electric motors in the country, the reasons for the lack of development of electric transportation in the country and the lack of commercialization of electric motors are examined in this report. Forecasting the development trend of electric cars in the world, the share of sales of electric cars in the world in 2020, 2025 and 2030 is predicted to be 2, 8 and 20 percent of the total car sales market, respectively, and finally in 2040 between 35 and 47 percent of The sales of new cars are attributed to electric cars. Also, in terms of the number of cars, between 2015 and 2040, the share of electric cars will increase from 2 million cars in 2016 to more than 40 million cars out of a total of 190 million car sales in 2040. At the same time, it is predicted that China, the United States of America and Europe will occupy more than 60% of the global electric vehicle market by 2040. On the other hand, due to the high price of lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars, forecasts indicate that the price of these batteries will decrease by 2030. So that the average price of these batteries, which was estimated at 273 dollars/kWh in 2016, will reach 109 dollars/kWh in 2025 and 74 dollars/kWh in 2030. At the same time, it is predicted that the electricity consumption of electric vehicles will increase from 6 terawatt hours in 2016 to 1800 terawatt hours in 2040 (5%\nDocument [6]: How is the electric car sales market in China? Reports indicate that 1.18 million electric vehicles were sold in China in 2019. According to Isna, in recent years, when the purchase and use of electric, clean and environmentally friendly cars have received a great reception, many automobile companies in the world are developing, producing and supplying electric, hybrid and plug-in vehicles. They have turned to hybrids. Now, the latest statistics and reports published on the clean technica website show that 1.18 million electrical devices were launched and sold in the Chinese market in 2019. This indicates that Chinese customers have received a unique welcome to buy clean products, and thus the sales trend of electric cars in this country has been reported to be growing and rising. China is considered one of the largest car sales markets in the world, and if it experiences a decreasing or increasing trend, experts and analysts usually generalize it to many other global markets. This is while some of them believe that the sale of electric cars in China has experienced a declining trend in the last six months and has not faced a significant rise as before. More than 150,000 electric cars were sold in December 2019, which has decreased by 22% compared to the same period last year, but the total share of electric cars in this country has reached 6.8%. end of message\nDocument [7]: Automobile world; Showcasing the most luxurious Mercedes-Benz model in Beijing this week in the automotive world: the new Mercedes-Maybach concept for Chinese tastes, the unveiling of Mercedes-Benz's smallest sedan, the rush of new Chinese automakers to take a share of the electric car market and the unveiling of BMW's latest electric model in Beijing Food Fair.

In a report, the webuyanycar website has discussed the contribution of different countries in the world to measures related to reducing air pollution and encouraging citizens to buy electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars and the level of people's acceptance of these products: Norway Norway as a green and sparsely populated country in Northern Europe and the Scandinavian region is one of the pioneers in protecting the environment and reducing the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere. In line with this goal, it has taken many measures to reduce the reception of polluting gasoline and diesel cars and increase the popularity of clean electric cars. which ultimately caused the purchase and use of the mentioned vehicles in this country to face a significant growth, which was unprecedented and unique in its kind in the world. The authorities and officials of this country have repeatedly announced that with the aim of reducing the purchase of polluting gasoline and diesel cars to zero, as well as reducing greenhouse and carbon emissions to the atmosphere, they intend to develop and build the necessary infrastructure early for the optimal and easy use of electric cars such as Set up charging stations at short distances in all the streets and roads of this country. Previously,\nDocument [9]: The electric car market in China has overtaken the United States. Published reports show that the popularity of buying electric cars in China has greatly increased since 2015 and has overtaken the American market. According to Isna, due to the popularity of electric cars and the unique reception of customers in the global markets in recent years, many car manufacturing companies have turned to the production and supply of electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars in order to respond to the needs and demands of the market. data and take a significant share of global markets. China and the United States of America, which are two large and important economic countries in the world, their car sales market is always of special importance for international car manufacturing companies. According to the report published by the research and statistical institute Statista about the comparison of the sales and supply of electric, clean and environmentally friendly cars in the two markets of China and the United States of America, which includes all-electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars, the sales of these vehicles The number of vehicles in China has been much higher than in the United States, so that in 2018, the sales of electric vehicles in China reached 1.255 million, while the sales of these products in the American market last year were 361,000. There were 307 devices. With a brief look at the chart presented by Statista, until 2014, the sales of electric cars in these two countries experienced a trend exactly opposite to the current trend, but from 2015 onwards, the acceptance of clean and environmentally friendly cars by Chinese customers has increased. The intensity has increased and has surpassed American customers in this regard. Since then, the sales and supply of electric cars in China has been much higher and more significant than the US market. On the other hand, with the increasing trend of sales of electric cars in China, many successful international car manufacturers such as Tesla Motors of America and Volkswagen of Germany have decided to produce and supply exclusive products for the Chinese market. In recent years, many automobile companies in the world have been attracted to the production and development of electric, clean and environmentally friendly vehicles under the influence of the increasing importance of issues such as dealing with air pollution, the release of dangerous and polluting gases into the atmosphere, and the destruction of the environment. that now there is a tight competition for the production and introduction and supply of electric and electric cars in the world, so that each of them will unveil new and better models for themselves and then send them to the global markets. end of message\nDocument [10]: Chery sued Mercedes-Benz! - Asr writing, the Chinese automobile manufacturer Chery filed an official complaint against the Mercedes-Benz company yesterday. Chery's complaint, which was submitted to the trademark office of the US Department of Industry and Commerce yesterday, is about the name chosen by Mercedes-Benz to name the company's electric vehicle. At the Paris Motor Show, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its near-real concept electric car called Generation EQ, which can travel 500 kilometers on a single charge. This product is in the category of small crossovers (cars with the same appearance as 4WD SUVs, but with front-wheel drive and smaller dimensions), which is usually not the ideal platform for manufacturers for electric vehicles, and therefore can be highly attractive. According to the company's speech at the exhibition, Benz is going to release 10 other electric cars under the EQ sub-brand by 2015 and take a significant share of this market. On the other hand, Chery has released its two-door electric cars under the name eQ in China two years ago, and the presence of Benz with the same sub-brand in this market can affect Chery. The Chinese market is considered to be the most popular electric car market in the world, where the sales of electric cars in this market alone are more than the entire market of this type of cars in the world. One of the reasons for the popularity of electric cars in China is the support of the government and the governing body of this country due to issues related to air pollution. Benz company and Daimler Group have not yet taken a position regarding this Chery complaint. If a decision is issued in favor of Chery in the court, Benz company will most likely be banned from producing electric cars with this name in China. Source\n\nReport:

The Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, and even the South China Sea were once regarded as the most likely gunpowder stores to trigger conflicts or wars. The evolution of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region is often mixed with conflicts of interest and strategic contradictions among international powers. The situation on the Korean Peninsula is gradually easing, but the competition between the United States and China over the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea issues may be relatively heightened. The Singapore Summit ended dramatically like a science fiction movie. However, because the decision-making styles of Trump and Kim Jong-un completely broke away from the traditional diplomatic negotiation model, coupled with the tacit understanding and understanding between China and North Korea, the geostrategic contest between the United States and China over Northeast Asia was not completely clear. , the ending of the "North Korea Round" can only be said to be a staged ending. As an important member of the Asia-Pacific region on economic and security issues, Taiwan should respond prudently to the subsequent developments in the new situation between the United States and North Korea. In particular, the preliminary results of the "double suspension" reached at the summit: North Korea suspended nuclear tests and the United States and South Korea suspended joint military exercises. This is consistent with Beijing's policy initiatives in recent years. Whether Beijing plays a supporting or promoting role behind the scenes should be observed calmly. Professional interpretation. Trump, who often makes unreasonable moves, had just praised mainland leaders as very special "great leaders" at a press conference in Singapore. However, during an interview on "Air Force One" on his way back to the United States, he also said that in the next few years This week, the United States will put "very tough" pressure on China on trade. Beijing should be used to Trump's dual tactics of "both coalition and struggle". Mainstream media in Europe and the United States generally commented that Beijing was the "winner" behind the Singapore Summit, mainly because Beijing quietly lent Air China's special plane to "escort" Kim Jong-un; on the eve of the summit, China and North Korea even had two unusual "Xi-Kim meetings" (Diaoyu Tai in Beijing , Dalian Bangchui Island", China and North Korea are rapidly repairing bilateral relations, making Beijing's potential influence on the peninsula situation widely noticed.

The Singapore Joint Statement contains a broad framework agreement on new North Korea-US relations, a peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and complete denuclearization.

Just as the Berlin Declaration was issued in Germany in July 2017 when North Korea carried out missile provocations, President Moon Jae-in is expected to adopt this Oslo Declaration and put forward decisive proposals towards North Korea aimed at resuming dialogue between North Korea and the United States.

But North Korea is standoffish. Because of this, President Moon Jae-in is even more hopeful that the Oslo Declaration will serve as an opportunity to persuade North Korea. However, if we look back at the Berlin Declaration, which the Moon Jae-in administration considers to be a "success myth," it was only a verbal declaration at the time. After the "Berlin Declaration" was issued, North Korea instead used greater provocations to plunge the Korean peninsula into an imminent crisis.

Ross Darrell Feingold, a political risk consultant in Washington, told a reporter from Central News Agency that if outsiders doubt what kind of agreement will be reached before the Trump-Kim meeting, whether Trump will even negotiate Compared with other speculations, the outcome of this Sichuan-Golden Summit is already a pretty good start. U.S. President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held the first summit in the history of the two countries' sitting leaders in Singapore on the 12th. The two sides signed a joint statement after the meeting, in which North Korea reiterated its compliance with the "Panmunjom Declaration" of April 27, 2018, on denuclearization issues that are of concern to the outside world, and pledged to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. (Central News Agency reporter Huang Ziqiang, Singapore, 14th) After the conclusion of the "Sichuan-Kim Summit", scholars analyzed that although the summit was internationally recognized and brought hope for peace on the Korean Peninsula, "denuclearization" only contained principled words and key details. Despite this, long-term development remains to be seen. He pointed out that judging from the text of the joint statement, North Korea needs economic and medical assistance and the relaxation of United Nations sanctions. North Korea will work towards denuclearization in the short or medium term. It will not be just superficial words, but there will be more that can be proved to the international community. Specific actions and long-term development remain to be seen. Wu Yishan, senior adviser for international affairs at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute (ASLI), a Malaysian think tank, said that the joint statement reached by the Trump-Kim meeting is only a "beginning" and only has a principled framework for the denuclearization that is of concern to the outside world. The future development of the Korean Peninsula , it still depends on the specific actions of both parties before further study and judgment can be made. Zheng Yuqin, director of the Czech Central European Institute of Political Economy, pointed out that the Sichuan-Kim Summit symbolizes the last piece of ice showing signs of melting after the Cold War. Although the talks between the two sides are harmonious, there is still a long way to go, whether from denuclearization to the end of the trade blockade, or from hostility to friendship. He said that Kim Jong-un will gain more "political dividends" through the Trump-Kim meeting and consolidate the North Korean people's loyalty to the Kim regime. Huang Huihua, a researcher at Taiwan's Asia-Pacific Defense Research Center who studies the regional security situation in East Asia, believes that although the Trump-Kim meeting has opened up a new situation in relations between the United States and North Korea, and Kim Jong-un has also promised to initiate denuclearization, there are still many deep-seated conflicts between the two countries, such as economic sanctions, Issues such as the U.S. military garrison and the U.S.-South Korea alliance still take time to resolve. According to Huang Huihua's analysis, although Kim Jong-un signed a joint statement to\nDocument [7]: One-year anniversary of the "6.12 Singapore Joint Statement" issued by the leaders of North Korea and the United States cKBS News On the one-year anniversary of the "6.12 Singapore Joint Statement" issued by the leaders of North Korea and the United States, signs of breaking the deadlock in dialogue between North Korea and the United States are becoming increasingly active. U.S. President Trump publicly received a personal letter from North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un on the 11th of this month, saying that "good things will happen." South Korean President Moon Jae-in also hopes to hold a North-South summit as soon as possible. Trump attended the press conference held at the White House that day. Regarding the issue of holding summit talks with Kim Jong-un, he said: "I just received a 'warm and friendly' personal letter from Kim Jong-un." However, Trump did not specify the content of the personal letter or how it was delivered to him. At the press conference, Trump remained open to holding a third summit between North Korea and the United States, but he only said that he would discuss the matter "later" as to when it would be held. This is the first time that Kim Jong-un has conveyed a personal letter to Trump since the second summit meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam from February 27 to 28 this year ended without any results. On the other hand, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who concluded his state visit to Norway, expressed his hope to hold a North-South summit before the South Korea-US summit when attending the Oslo Forum. He said that the leaders of North Korea and the United States should meet as soon as possible, but whether and when we meet depends on Chairman Kim's choice. The "6·12 Singapore Joint Statement" was signed by North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Trump during their first meeting in Singapore on June 12 last year. The main contents include establishing a new relationship between North Korea and the United States and ensuring a peace mechanism on the peninsula. , North Korea’s complete denuclearization and North Korea’s return of the remains of U.S. troops killed in the Korean War. Some commentators believe that North Korea and the United States issued a joint statement for the first time under long-term hostility. Even if it is limited to a declaration, it is still of historical significance. The North Korean nuclear issue was in a state of tension that was "on the verge of breaking out" until the end of 2017. As North Korea participated in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics held in early 2018, the peninsula quickly shifted from tense situations to dialogue. After the high-level talks between the two Koreas, the April 27 inter-Korean summit and the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration, the conditions for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through peaceful means have matured, which ultimately led to the summit between North Korea and the United States. The first round of summit talks between North Korea and the United States went through many hardships\nDocument [8]: Japanese media: RCEP will be difficult to negotiate within this year, and there are obvious differences among 16 countries including China, Japan, and South Korea. November 13, 2018 15:39 Business Huang Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) Ministerial Conference, countries have obvious differences, and there are great difficulties in achieving the goals agreed within this year. The report quoted negotiating sources as saying that Singapore, the country chairing the talks, proposed to include "achieving substantive progress" in the joint statement issued after a series of consultations, instead of "reaching substantive compromise." It is reported that all parties participating in the meeting unanimously agreed to give up reaching a substantive compromise within the year. In an interview with the media after the ministerial meeting, Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said that some progress has been made in some areas, while admitting that there are still areas where there is no agreement. Regarding the content of the joint statement, Seko pointed out that it will ultimately be judged by the leaders. The RCEP negotiations that began in 2013 and continue to this day have focused on discussions in about 20 areas. The parties have previously reached agreements in five areas including economic and technological cooperation, but areas prone to conflicts of interest, such as tariff reduction and the formulation of intellectual property protection rules, have not yet been resolved. According to reports, the ministerial meeting in August confirmed the relevant content regarding the extent of agreement in the remaining areas that would be considered a substantive compromise. All parties originally strived to reach a substantive compromise at this meeting. India, which is cautious about significantly reducing tariffs on goods, has significant differences with Japan and Australia, which demand high-level trade liberalization. If RCEP can be realized, it will form a huge economic circle with a population accounting for about half of the world, and a trade volume and gross domestic product (GDP) accounting for 30% of the global total. At the same time, it can also show a stance of confrontation with the protectionism forcibly promoted by the Trump administration and others in the United States. (Business and Industry)\nDocument [9]: When Trump takes action, he cares about people’s lives June 21, 2018 04:10 China Times Lu Xinchang attended the G7 summit held in neighboring Canada. Trump was also distracted at the same time. On the one hand, he was closely involved in this summit. According to the joint statement, it is necessary to re-establish mutual trust in an open trading system amidst conflicts and retaliation from all parties; on the other hand, we must pay close attention to the nuclear abolition and Northeast Asian security issues led by Secretary of State Pompeo. The Singaporean and North Korean delegations have prepared pre-meeting consultations. President Trump, who is supervising the war between the two sides, declared beforehand that he would not hesitate to tear down and start over, including destroying the consensus reached, in order to maintain the US position and the bottom line of negotiations. Because at a joint press conference, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau once again brought up his dissatisfaction that the steel and aluminum tax hikes were out of national security considerations; he discussed and agreed with the joint statement in person, and then rushed to the United States to attend the US-North Korea talks. After receiving the relevant reports from the press conference, President Trump immediately issued instructions on the presidential plane to withdraw the signing of the joint statement of this G7 summit. Fortunately, the much-anticipated Sichuan-Kim talks went relatively smoothly and harmoniously. The first negotiation between the United States and North Korea ended with the signing of a four-point consensus, which gave the host Singapore a lot of face. However, this agreement may have come too suddenly and the process was too harmonious. As a result, people from all walks of life always have a sense of disbelief and concern about the future interaction between North Korea and the United States. They are worried that the future interaction between North Korea and the United States will still be a hidden mystery. First of all, the United States and North Korea, which continue to maintain a state of war, not only did not allow South Korean President Moon Jae-in, one of the promoters of peace, to attend the ceremony in Singapore, even the issue of the peace agreement signed by the two Koreas was completely absent. Can't reach the countertop. Secondly, Trump announced the suspension of routine military exercises between the United States and South Korea without conducting internal military exercises, causing an uproar among all parties. However, the new U.S. ambassador to South Korea immediately expressed support, while the Department of Defense responded by saying "it will only make adjustments to the form of military exercises", showing due respect for the power of commander. Trump also gave a speech during a public trip this week, reaffirming his determination to end US-South Korea military exercises. As stakeholders, the South Korean government and opposition parties expressed a cautious but optimistic attitude towards President Trump's suspension of military exercises, and reiterated the pursuit of the goal of signing a peace agreement between the two Koreas.

Meeting between Trump and Kim: what was agreed upon and what’s next The meeting of the leaders of the DPRK and the United States, which seemed impossible, took place. But can its results really be called historical? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This meeting seemed impossible just a few months ago, when the DPRK and the United States regularly exchanged threats. However, today in Singapore, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un shook hands against the backdrop of national flags. What does the statement signed by the parties mean and what to expect next - in the material LIGA.net. Where did it start? In 2017, the DPRK actively conducted missile tests, to which Trump threatened to respond with “fire and fury” and sent a squadron led by an aircraft carrier to the shores of the DPRK. Tensions peaked in the fall of 2017, when North Korea tested a hydrogen charge and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. American sanctions against North Korea have been in effect for almost 70 years. In 2017, the US government reinforced them with a ban on Americans visiting the DPRK, and in 2018, the law once again enshrined all restrictions against North Korea. But at the beginning of March 2018, the White House announced that Trump would meet with Kim Jong-un and began preparations for it. And in April, another landmark summit took place - South and North Korea, at which the heads of countries signed a joint declaration on the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. How did the summit go? At today's meeting, Trump and Kim shook hands with a friendly expression against the backdrop of the US and North Korean flags. Later, sitting opposite each other, both politicians seemed quite relaxed. Although many eyewitnesses noted that their body language “revealed the nervousness of the first meeting.” The negotiations lasted about 40 minutes, although according to the plan they were allotted about two hours. Trump and Kim spoke face-to-face, accompanied by interpreters. It was only at the working lunch that they were joined by small delegations from each side. From the point of view of diplomatic protocol and etiquette, everything went well - no problems were reported. What are the results. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un signed a joint document that contains four points: - The United States and North Korea undertake to “establish new relations”; - will make efforts to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula; - North Korea is committed to the April Declaration on Denuclearization; - Countries have pledged to return the remains of prisoners of war and missing persons. In the enlarged photo of the document published by journalists, one can also see the lines that Trump is ready to “provide security guarantees to the DPRK” in exchange for nuclear disarmament of North Korea. At the briefing, Trump revealed another detail: the United States will suspend military exercises with South Korea while negotiations on North Korea's nuclear disarmament are moving in the right direction. But they will not reduce the military contingent\nDocument [3]: The USA and the DPRK will form a working group on denuclearization issues October 7, Minsk / Corr. BELTA/.

Vladimir Putin took part in the Russia-Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, the main result of which was the signing of a joint statement on strategic partnership. In addition, Russia will join ASEAN plans to create “smart cities,” the Russian President said. Security measures in Singapore have been seriously strengthened in connection with the summit. Along with five thousand police officers and thousands of video cameras, the territory is patrolled by police robots that conduct 360-degree video recording. The Russia-ASEAN summit was attended by the leadership of Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos and Myanmar. The previous Russia-ASEAN summit was held in 2016 in Sochi, and then, Vladimir Putin recalled, the task was set to bring dialogue relations with the association to the level of strategic partnership. Following the results of the current summit, the leaders of Russia and the ASEAN countries came to a corresponding joint statement, agreeing to “increase economic cooperation despite increasing protectionism.” As follows from the document, Russia and ASEAN countries aim to “strengthen physical and institutional interconnectedness in the interests of bringing markets closer together”, increase cooperation in the field of agriculture, science, technology and innovation, strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism, ensure maritime security, freedom of navigation and air navigation, develop cooperation in the field of healthcare, including the fight against infectious diseases and new infections, as well as in the field of environmental protection. “Among ASEAN’s other partners, I don’t remember such a short period of time to achieve a strategic partnership,” noted Alexander Ivanov, the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to ASEAN, answering a question from RG. He noted that bringing relations with the association to the highest level will give impetus to the development of cooperation in all areas. Russia has been a dialogue partner with this association since 1996. Over the past year, interaction has become noticeably wider. First of all, the political dialogue has intensified - Russia's permanent mission to ASEAN has been operating in Jakarta since last year. “We are coordinating our approaches on key problems of the Asia-Pacific region, challenges and threats to regional stability, strengthening cooperation in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime,” Vladimir Putin noted at the plenary meeting. Economic ties are also strengthening. Russia's total trade turnover with the association grew by more than a third last year, reaching $18.3 billion. And the volume of mutual accumulated investments exceeds $25 billion. The roadmap for business cooperation includes 60 joint projects in industry and high technology and, according to Putin, is being successfully implemented. Cooperation programs have been adopted in the fields of energy and agriculture. In the spring, a network of research centers of leading universities in Russia and ASEAN began to function, and two weeks ago it was decided to launch a Russia-ASEAN working group in the field of education. At the summit, the Russian leader announced another important area of ​​cooperation. “Russia will join ASEAN’s plans to create a network\nDocument [8]: Media: Pompeo will give Kim Jong-un a disc with Elton John's song about "Rocket Man" BEIJING, July 6. /TASS/.

My audience is interested in traveling to Australia and have a particular interest in these animals.\n\nDocument [1]: "Tasmanian devil" has been extinct for 3,000 years and 26 have been released back into the wild to fight for offspring - the cute pet "Tasmanian devil (Tasmanian devil)" Tasmanian devil is a marsupial carnivore with a body shape similar to that of a puppy Almost the same, but they are stronger and more muscular. They have been extinct in mainland Australia for more than 3,000 years. Recently, 26 individuals have been reintroduced. Experts believe that this can restore and rebalance the forest ecology, and hope to usher in new life in the 2021 breeding season. The "Tasmanian Devil" Tasmanian devil is about the same size as a puppy, but is stronger and more muscular (Video source/youtube/WildArk) According to "CNN", the Tasmanian devil became the living species after the thylacine became extinct in 1936. The largest carnivorous marsupial, however, due to the presence of Dingo dogs in Australia, the Tasmanian devils gradually disappeared from the Australian continent. After that, only Tasmania had the only remaining Tasmanian devils, but In the 1990s, an unknown infectious disease called Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD) appeared in the local area, causing a sharp decline in the number of Tasmanian devils. Since the Tasmanian devils were discovered in 1996, unknown diseases have killed about 90% of the Tasmanian devils. Today, there are only 25,000 wild Tasmanian devils left in Tasmania, so they are listed as " "Endangered" (EN), the conservation group "Aussie Ark" has been trying to rehabilitate Tasmanian devils in the past 10 years to prevent them from becoming extinct due to facial tumor disease. The plan started in 2011, when the Tasmanian devils were only 44 There are only more than 200 of them now. .@CNNTravel: Eleven Tasmanian devils have been reintroduced to mainland Australia, more than 3,000 years after they died out there. https://t.co/xJeD4nUAYH — CNN Asia Pacific (@cnnasiapr) October 6, 2020 The Australian Ark was recently unveiled in Pakistan On Barrington Tops, 26 Tasmanian devils are released into the wild in a 400-hectare reserve, and radio collars, infrared cameras, etc. are used to regularly track the status of the animals. Tim Faulkner, president of the organization, said, "100 Today, years later, when we look back on this day, it will be an important historical moment in promoting the ecological restoration of the entire country." He even mentioned that this move would not only reintroduce one of Australia's most popular animals, "but also transform the entire environment, restoring and rebalancing the forest ecology after hundreds of years of damage from foxes and other invasive predators." . The Tasmanian devil has black fur and emits a foul smell and a harsh cry when attacked. In addition to hunting, it also eats carrion, usually alone, but occasionally eats with other Tasmanian devils.\nDocument [2]: Training dogs to detect pheromones helps to artificially restore Tasmanian devils. Australian research institutions have introduced dogs to assist in the restoration of endangered Tasmanian devils. The research team said that using dogs' sensitive sense of smell, they can detect when captive-bred female Tasmanian devils show pheromones in estrus, allowing the team to assist females and males in mating to successfully pass on the family line. The research team said that the initial results of the plan are promising and that it is expected to assist the recovery plans of other endangered species in the future. Dogs Assist in Artificial Rehabilitation The BBC reported that the Australian research team rehabilitating Tasmanian devils is the first in the world to try to use dogs to assist in rehabilitation. The team said that even though endangered species were raised in captivity by research teams in the past to perform artificial rehabilitation, it was difficult to assist in mating for species whose estrus behavior was not obvious (such as emitting pheromones that cannot be detected by humans), so the rehabilitation work was naturally difficult. Difficulties abound. In order to solve this problem, the research team introduced dogs, hoping to use the dogs' sense of smell to help identify the estrus period of female Tasmanian devils. During the training process, the research team built a ring device filled with different smells and trained the dogs to identify the mating signals of female Tasmanian devils. Once the dogs smell the right signal, they notify researchers, who can assist the Tasmanian devils in mating and breeding. The research team said that although it is still in the experimental stage, the results are very smooth, and they believe that with the help of dogs, the success rate of artificial rehabilitation is expected to be improved. If implemented successfully, it may be applied to other endangered species that emit pheromones during estrus in the future. It is not easy to restore the Tasmanian devil. According to the [Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources](https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/save-the-tasmanian-devil-program}, only wild Tasmanian devils are currently available. There is Tasmania in Australia, commonly known as the "Tasmanian Devil". In addition to hunting, there are also unknown infectious diseases. Since the 1990s, the wild population has dropped sharply from 150,000 to 25,000. In 2020, the conservation group "Australia Ark" began to implement an artificial restoration plan with the aim of restoring the population of Tasmanian devils to stability. At that time, 26 Tasmanian devils were sent to a sanctuary near Mount Barrington National Park in Australia. Introducing dogs to assist Tasmanian devils in mating is part of the rehabilitation plan [For more exciting content, see]\nDocument [3]: The Tasmanian devil, extinct on the mainland for 3000 years, has returned to the wild in Australia | Instant News | Asia, Europe and Africa | on.cc East Network The Tasmanian devil, a unique animal in Australia known as the "Tasmanian Devil", was listed as endangered in 2008 An extinct animal that currently only exists on the Australian island of Tasmania. A number of Australian animal organizations have been working together since March this year to reintroduce Tasmanian devils into the wild in the country. This is the first time in 3,000 years that Tasmanian devils have reappeared on the Australian mainland. Aussie Ark is leading the preparations for the island conservation plan, releasing healthy young Tasmanian devils in batches into a large, fenced reserve covering an area of ​​400 hectares in Barrington Tops, north of Sydney. The first batch of 15 Tasmanian devils were released in March this year, and 11 more were released last month. A team led by Hollywood actor and "Thor" Chris Hemsworth will release another 11 on Monday (5th). 26 will be released to coincide with the breeding season in February next year. It is expected that an additional 40 Tasmanian devils will be released into the reserve within the next two years. The organization hopes that placing Tasmanian devils in a protected area will help improve the survival and reproduction rates of Tasmanian devils in the area. Through the monitoring system, it can be seen that the Tasmanian devils currently released are in good condition. The Tasmanian devil is the largest living carnivore of the order Quoll, known for its powerful jaws that can crush bones. An adult Tasmanian devil weighs about 8 kilograms. The name "Tasmanian devil" comes from its high-decibel screams and its feeding characteristics of competing for animal carcasses, but animal experts say the species poses no threat to humans or agriculture. Because Tasmanian devils hunt foxes that pose a threat to other animals and remove diseased animals, they also play a certain role in environmental protection. However, the number has dropped sharply in the past 20 years due to the threat of facial cancer, and there are less than 25,000 in Tasmania.\nDocument [4]: After being extinct for 3,000 years, the "Tasmanian devil" has returned to the Australian mainland. The Tasmanian devil on the Australian island of Tasmania is the largest carnivorous marsupial in existence and was listed as an endangered species in 2008. (European News Agency) 2020/10/06 10:33 [Instant News/Comprehensive Report] With shiny black fur and loud and harsh calls, the Tasmanian devil on the Australian island of Tasmania is the largest carnivorous marsupial in existence. In 2008 Listed as an endangered species in 2001, they became extinct on the Australian mainland 3,000 years ago and now only exist on the island of Tasmania. They are nocturnal and mainly eat scavengers. They look cute but have a bad temper. The locals gave them nicknames "Tasmanian devil". In conjunction with the breeding season, animal protection groups will release dozens of Tasmanian devils into the wild in batches this year in large protected areas, hoping to increase the survival rate of Tasmanian devils and naturally increase their reproduction rate. According to the "BBC" report, the animal protection organization "Aussie Ark" cooperated with other animal organizations to release 15 Tasmanian devils into the wild in March this year into a 400-hectare reserve in Barrington Tops, north of Sydney. , observing that the release plan has achieved good results, the animal protection group released 11 Tasmanian devils into the wild in September this year; on the 5th of this month, the animal protection group announced that 26 Tasmanian devils had joined the wild release, hoping to cooperate During the breeding season in February, let these healthy, young Tasmanian devils "do what they have to do." Please read on... In the next two years, it is expected that another 40 Tasmanian devils will be released into the area. Tim Faulkner, chairman of Australia Ark, said that the Tasmanian devils are not subject to any restrictions in the reserve, but They are still closely monitored by animal protection groups. The Barrington Heights Reserve is fenced off, and Aussie Ark's long-term goal is to one day release Tasmanian devils into the wild without fences. As the number of dingoes in Australia increases, experts believe that the number of Tasmanian devils on the Australian continent has declined, and they became extinct on the Australian mainland 3,000 years ago. Tasmanian devils now only exist on the island of Tasmania. In the 1990s, experts calculated There are supposed to be 150,000 Tasmanian devils on the island, but in the past 20 years, affected by the infectious cancer "Demon Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD)", the number of Tasmanian devils has dropped by 90%, making them enter the endangered species list in 2008. It is estimated that there are less than 25,000 individuals. Although Tasmanian devils are carnivores, animal experts say these little "devils" are harmless to humans and agriculture.

The authorities moved the Tasmanian devils to Maria Island in Tasmania in 2012. For many years, The Tasmanian devil population recovered, but this conservation plan put penguins and other birds on the island in danger of extinction. In the past, Tasmanian devils were on the verge of extinction due to Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). The Tasmanian devil is listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The Australian federal government and the Tasmanian government jointly launched the "Save the Tasmanian Devil Project" (STDP) to move the devils to Maria Island. But in 2011, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water Resources and Environment proposed that the introduction of Tasmanian devils to Maria Island would have a negative impact on the penguins and seagulls on the island. Tasmanian devils wiped out water squirrels and affected the survival of penguins. The Tasmanian Bird Conservancy cited a government survey as saying that 3,000 pairs of penguins had disappeared from the island in 2012. A paper published last year in the Journal of Ecological Conservation found that Tasmanian devils "annihilated" water worms. "Losing 3,000 pairs of penguins from a national park island that is supposed to be a refuge for this species is basically a major blow," said researcher Eric Woehler. The results are not surprising given studies showing mammals being introduced to ocean islands. . Waller said the Tasmanian devil population has recovered in Tasmania and the Australian outback, with more than 1,000 babies born last month for the first time. He pointed out that moving the devils out of Maria Island "will not have any negative impact on the devils." A spokesman for the Tasmanian government responded that the program would "continue to develop with priority given to new knowledge and emerging science." But the spokesperson also pointed out that Maria Island is still an important part of the plan to help restore and maintain the wild Tasmanian devil population in Tasmania.

Local NGO Aussie Ark said seven young Tasmanian devils were born at Barrington Wildlife Sanctuary in New South Wales. Aussie Ark announced the good news in an Instagram post on Monday (24th). As of September last year, Aussie Ark had released a total of 26 Tasmanian devils on the Australian mainland. These Tasmanian devils successfully mated and gave birth to babies. Conservation staff confirmed that the young Tasmanian devil remained in the mother's bag and was only as big as a peanut. According to the description on the Tourism Australia website, a female badger will give birth to 20 to 40 cubs at a time, but she can only nurse 4 cubs. Therefore, the cubs must run quickly into the mother badger's nursery pouch to successfully "touch down". The young badgers live in the pouch for three months. Tasmanian devils were almost extinct on the Australian mainland due to the introduction of wild dogs from Australia in the early years, and Tasmania became their only refuge. However, since Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease was discovered in 1996, this infectious disease has spread widely among the Tasmanian devil population, causing the number of Tasmanian devils to drop by 90%. Aussie Ark said there are only 25,000 Tasmanian devils left in Tasmania so far. The Tasmanian devil is the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world and is the apex predator in the food chain. Their return to the wild can reduce the hunting of other endangered species by foxes and feral cats. Tasmanian devils are also scavengers, which can reduce the spread of diseases in their habitat. Aussie Ark said in a statement: "We have been working hard for the past ten years to return Tasmanian devils to the wild, hoping that they can continue to reproduce on their own. To be able to confirm the birth of wild Tasmanian devils for the first time in many years is truly a historic moment."

Tasmanian devils have been born in the wild in Australia Conservationists say it is a major success in efforts to return the marsupial to the mainland. Tasmanian devils have been born in the wild on mainland Australia for the first time in more than 3,000 years, Livescience reports. Stay up to date with the Fast Focus telegram channel. Subscribe Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials that were once found on the Australian mainland. But the first European settlers quickly wiped out the Tasmanian devils there. Therefore, the animals are now endemic to the island of Tasmania, which is located off the southern coast of Australia. However, even there the species is now endangered. To save the species from extinction, conservation organization Aussie Ark, in partnership with Re:wild and WildArk, began a Tasmanian devil restoration project on the Australian mainland in 2011. That same year, they brought 44 Tasmanian devils to Australia, where more than 390 babies have since been born under human care. Last year, scientists released 26 Tasmanian devils into the wild at the 400-hectare reserve, making them the first wild Tasmanian devils in Australia since they were extirpated. According to Aussie Ark, at least seven cubs have now been born to wild devils, with the actual number likely to be closer to 20. population," says Tim Faulkner, president of Aussie Ark. Tasmanian devils reproduce in the same way as kangaroos: the offspring are born prematurely and then continue to develop in the mother's pouch. Females give birth to 20 to 30 tiny babies after just three weeks of pregnancy. But a maximum of four survive. Tasmanian devils are carnivorous animals, but prefer to feed on carrion left by other predators. They have an excellent sense of smell to detect animal remains, as well as powerful jaws that allow them to eat even bones. Aussie Ark says scavengers such as Tasmanian devils are important because they help keep ecosystems clean and prevent the spread of diseases that develop in decomposing carcasses.\nDocument [2]: Devilish sense of humor. In Australia, rescued Tasmanian devils have destroyed the penguin population. The mammals were sent to Maria Island as part of a program to save the species from extinction. In Australia, a conservation project for endangered Tasmanian devils backfired after the predators killed large numbers of seabirds. The BBC reports this. Stay up to date with events with the Quick Focus telegram channel. Subscribe Back in 2012, a small number of Tasmanian devils were sent to Maria Island, east of Tasmania, Australia. Thus, they tried to protect animals from a type of cancer that led to their extinction. The devil population was saved, but at a high price. Conservation organization BirdLife Tasmania said the presence of devils on the island had "catastrophic impacts on one or more bird species". The population of little penguins, which in 2012 numbered about 3 thousand nesting pairs, has completely disappeared from the island. "The loss of 3,000 pairs of penguins from an island national park that was supposed to be a sanctuary for this species is essentially a major blow," says research team member Eric Wöhler. According to him, this result was not unexpected, given previous studies. In 2011, one report suggested that the appearance of devils would "negatively impact little penguin and petrel colonies on Maria Island." Last year, a paper published in the journal Biological Conservation said the devils had indeed "destroyed" a colony of petrels, a species of seabird. The mammals were relocated to the island as part of the Tasmanian Devil Rescue Program, a joint initiative between the Australian and Tasmanian governments. Tasmanian devils are still considered an endangered species. But Dr Wöhler says numbers have rebounded in Tasmania and mainland Australia, where baby devils were born for the first time in thousands of years last month. Given this, the expert believes that removing the devils from Maria Island "would not have any adverse effects on the devils."\nDocument [3]: Chris Hemsworth has reintroduced Tasmanian devils to the wild in Australia Tasmanian devils have become endangered after a mysterious infection wiped out almost the entire population of the animals in the island state of Tasmania. There are currently fewer than 25,000 Tasmanian devils living in the wild, although there were around 150,000 in the 1990s. On mainland Australia, these animals were destroyed by packs of dingo dogs about 3 thousand years ago.\nDocument [4]: Tasmanian devils were born in Australia for the first time in three thousand years. Tasmanian devils were born on mainland Australia for the first time in three thousand years. As Day.Az reports with reference to Lenta.ru, seven babies were born in the Barrington Wildlife Sanctuary in New South Wales. Currently, they are no larger than a shelled peanut kernel. A female Tasmanian devil brings from 20 to 40 cubs, but not all survive: she has only four teats in her pouch. Babies that have managed to gain a foothold will spend about three months in the bag. Last year, Aussie Ark returned 26 marsupials to the wild on mainland Australia. According to the organization's president, Tim Faulkner, the birth of Tasmanian devils gives hope for the emergence of new populations of endangered species. Tasmanian devils became extinct on the mainland after the introduction of dingoes, a type of wild dog. Since then, they have lived in the wild only on the island of Tasmania. However, the marsupial's population has been hit by a malignant disease known as Tasmanian devil facial tumor (DFTD). Since its discovery in 1996, about 90 percent of the population has died.\nDocument [5]: Tasmanian devils were born on mainland Australia for the first time in three thousand years. They disappeared there three thousand years ago and returned only in October 2020. For the first time in three thousand years, Tasmanian devils have been born on mainland Australia - these predatory marsupials disappeared there three thousand years ago and returned only in October last year. According to Reuters, seven little devils have now been born, each no larger than a peanut kernel. The Australian organization Aussie Ark is engaged in restoring the animal population: its volunteers returned Tasmanian devils to the mainland. The animals now live in the 400-hectare Barrington Wildlife Sanctuary in New South Wales. The birth of Tasmanian devils offers hope for the emergence of new populations of endangered species, Aussie Ark president Tim Faulkner said. For the last three thousand years, the Tasmanian devil has been found only on the island of Tasmania, south of mainland Australia. It is believed that the population of Australian devils that inhabited the forests on the mainland was destroyed by dingoes. There were no these animals on the island, so the marsupials managed to survive there. The species is considered endangered: there are now 25 thousand devils in Tasmania, although 30 years ago there were 150 thousand. Most marsupial predators were struck by a contagious cancer to which they had already adapted.

This is reported by the non-profit environmental organization Aussie Ark. Seven individuals were born in Barrington Tops National Park (New South Wales). In October 2020, 26 adult Tasmanian devils were released into the area in hopes that they would begin to mate and breed. On the mainland, Tasmanian devils were exterminated by humans and wild dingoes three thousand years ago. Until recently, their natural habitat was the island of Tasmania, however, they are also endangered there. Aussie Ark was inspired by the experience of returning wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the USA. So far, a similar experiment with Tasmanian devils has been successful. The animals are threatened by natural enemies such as foxes and wild cats, but environmentalists hope that by the end of 2021, about 20 more Tasmanian devils will appear in Barrington Tops. In April, offspring of rare birds, Dalmatian pelicans, appeared at the Moscow Zoo. Now two chicks can be seen in the “Birds and Butterflies of the Tropics” pavilion, and in June they, together with adult birds, will go out to the “Swamp” outdoor aviary, where they will learn to swim.\nDocument [7]: They saved the Tasmanian devil, but destroyed the penguins: what happened in Australia They saved the Tasmanian devil, but destroyed the penguins: what happened in Australia To preserve the species, the marsupials were moved to the island. The resettlement of Tasmanian devils to the Australian island of Maria led to the death of 3 thousand pairs of small penguins and a number of other small birds. The BBC reports this. A group of Tasmanian devils were introduced to the island east of Tasmania in 2012 to conserve the species as part of a joint program between the Australian and Tasmanian governments. Since the 1990s, these marsupial predators have been affected by infectious facial cancer, which has threatened the existence of the species. The tumor is transmitted through bites and gradually grows so much that the animals cannot eat and die. Over the past period, according to various estimates, from 20 to 50% of the marsupial devil population died from it. It was decided to create a colony of healthy devils on the island. This caused the devil population to increase, but 3,000 breeding pairs of penguins disappeared from the island, and shearwaters were also reported missing. Also read Walked through the fire: a small Tasmanian cuscus was found in Australia for the first time after the fires. The Tasmanian devil is a mammal of the family of predatory marsupials. Its black coloring, huge mouth with sharp teeth, ominous night cries and ferocious disposition gave the first European settlers the reason to nickname this stocky predator “the devil”. This is a very voracious animal - its daily food intake is 15% of its body weight. In addition to its gluttony, this animal is distinguished by its indiscriminate eating habits - echidna needles, pieces of rubber, silver foil, pieces of leather boots and harness, dish towels and undigested carrots and ears of corn were found in its excrement.

Seven cubs of the endangered Tasmanian devil have been born at a sanctuary near Sydney, the BBC reports. In 2020, 26 adults were released by ecologists into a sanctuary on the Australian mainland. Tim Faulkner, from conservation organization Aussie Ark, said the devils adapted quite quickly after being released into the wild. He added that they watched them from afar until it was time to intervene and confirm the birth of the first cubs. Rangers examined the females' pouches and determined the females were healthy. It is believed that mammals on the Australian mainland were exterminated by packs of dingoes - wild dogs - about 3 thousand years ago. The last representatives of this species live on the island of Tasmania, which is part of Australia. Aussie Ark plans to release more Tasmanian devils into protected areas in the coming years, along with other animals such as koalas, bandicoots and wallabies. -0-\nDocument [9]: Tasmanian devils have destroyed the penguin population on the Australian island Tasmanian devils have destroyed the penguin population on the Australian island of Maria. The BBC reports this. A small number of Tasmanian devils were introduced to the island in 2012 to preserve the species as part of a joint program between the Australian and Tasmanian governments. Since then, there have indeed been more “devils”, but there are three thousand fewer penguins; a year earlier, the disappearance of petrel birds was recorded. According to Dr Eric Wehler, a researcher with the BirdLife Tasmania group, the presence of Tasmanian devils on Maria Island has had a catastrophic effect on the local bird fauna. In May, it was reported that Tasmanian devils were born in the wild on mainland Australia for the first time in more than 3,000 years. The world's largest surviving marsupial carnivore has been wiped out on the Australian mainland by the dingo, a type of wild dog. Since then, most of them have lived on the island state of Tasmania. However, their numbers in this territory have decreased since the 1990s to 25 thousand individuals.\nDocument [10]: Video of the day: For the first time in 3 thousand years, wild Tasmanian devils were born in Australia. All the animals' first offspring are healthy. Tasmanian devils, which were released into a protected wild area in the Australian state of New South Wales last year, gave birth to their first offspring - seven healthy cubs. According to the BBC, this is the first time this species has reproduced on mainland Australia in the last three thousand years. Tasmanian devils disappeared from the mainland following the arrival of the dingo, a type of wild dog. Their population has since been limited to the island of Tasmania. According to some estimates, at the end of the last century about 150 thousand representatives of the Tasmanian devil species lived there. However, in the late 1990s, they began to die en masse due to an infectious cancer - the so-called devil's face tumor disease (DFTD), which is transmitted through bites and kills the infected animal within a year and a half.\n\nReport:

According to comprehensive foreign media reports, the port city of Beira in Mozambique was severely hit by "Idai" and currently lacks clean water and sound sanitation facilities. Therefore, the focus of rescue has gradually shifted to preventing and containing malaria and cholera that many people believe are inevitable. disease outbreak. Ussein Isse, the country's director of national medical aid, said today that five cases of cholera have been detected in the impoverished Munhava community of Beira. "It's contagious and when you find one case, you have to expect more cases in the community," he said. There are also 2,700 people suffering from acute watery diarrhea, which may be a symptom of cholera, as one of the causes is infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Ise said that the Mozambican government has established a cholera treatment center at Beira Hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) is distributing 900,000 doses of oral cholera vaccine to affected areas. The WHO is concerned about the spread of diseases such as cholera in affected areas, and has previously warned of the possibility of a "second disaster." The death toll due to Typhoon Idai in Mozambique has risen to 468. Adding the deaths in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the total death toll has exceeded 700, and a large number of people are still missing.

This content was published at 9:35 pm on March 24, 2019 (AFP, Beira, Mozambique, 24th) Tropical Cyclone Idai hit southern Africa 10 days ago Officials in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi warned today that the threat of diseases such as cholera and malaria may further exacerbate the harsh environment faced by millions of survivors. Tropical Cyclone Idai hit the coast of Mozambique, bringing violent winds and rains that turned most parts of this impoverished country into a swamp, and then ravaged eastern Zimbabwe, killing 705 people and leaving hundreds more missing in the two countries. Including Malawi, more than 2 million people in the three countries were affected by the cyclone. Mozambique's Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said at a briefing in Beira, 1,000 kilometers northeast of the capital Maputo, that "cases of cholera and malaria are now inevitable." Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, deputy director of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), who was also at the briefing, warned that disease outbreaks in hard-to-reach areas could be a "very difficult" problem. Elaborating on efforts to control the emerging humanitarian crisis, Correia said: "To mitigate the epidemic, the government has set up cholera treatment centers. We should not be afraid when cholera problems arise, it is normal and almost inevitable. We know how malaria appears. "We have many wetlands where malaria will appear." The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a daily update that 74,600 women affected by the cyclone were pregnant, and about 60% of them would be pregnant within six months. During childbirth, at least 7,460 people faced life-threatening complications. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said some cases of cholera have been registered, but the United Nations was unable to confirm the report. Up to 109,000 people are now living in shelters in central Mozambique, many in or around Beira. James McQuen Patterson, director of health and nutrition at the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), told AFP that the shelters also "contain the risk of infectious diseases such as diarrhea and measles." He said: "In addition, because many families have lost everything and some people sleep outdoors, especially for children, the risk of pneumonia increases significantly." He also emphasized that help should be provided as soon as possible to the HIV epidemic in Sofala Province ) carriers and AIDS patients resume treatment.

Although it has been two weeks since the natural disaster, Mozambique is still devastated and vast, and the bodies of victims can be seen everywhere. In addition, the cholera epidemic continues to expand, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is actively preparing vaccines and mosquito nets due to concerns that the infection will get out of control. According to "NHK" reports, Idai hit southeast Africa in the middle of this month, killing more than 500 people in Mozambique. Due to the deterioration of sanitary conditions, cholera epidemics have been reported in the local area. Celso Ismael Correia, Minister of Land, Environment and Rural Development, who visited the most severely affected port city Beira on the 30th, pointed out that in Beira alone, the number of cholera patients has climbed to 271, and in other disaster-stricken areas There are also constant reports of diarrhea, and cholera is not ruled out. The report pointed out that the WHO will send 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine to the disaster-stricken areas in batches starting from April 1, and set up medical centers there. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of malaria and typhoid epidemics, 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine are currently being prepared. A mosquito net. In addition, as the drinking water in the disaster area is contaminated and sanitary conditions deteriorate, further expansion of infection cannot be ruled out. The United Nations calls on countries to provide emergency assistance such as medicine and drinking water as soon as possible. Want to read more news? Welcome to download the Free Times APP.

Tropical Cyclone Idai hits Africa hard, 1.7 million people affected 2019-03-23 ​​17:17 [Instant News/Comprehensive Report] Tropical Cyclone "Idai" has caused heavy damage since it hit southeastern Africa last Thursday. Especially after the two main local rivers burst their banks, the flooded area was so vast that it could even be seen from space. According to "CNN", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stationed in the local area said that the situation at the scene was "far worse than you can imagine" and that the floods provided excellent opportunities for malaria and cholera. hotbed. Satellite photos provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) show that the impact of the floods is so large that it can be clearly seen from space. A large red area is the home of about 200,000 people. An eyewitness who was rescued from the disaster area in Mozambique to a refugee camp said, "There is nothing there, it (the flood) destroyed everything." "Although relief workers continue to be stationed, the rescue speed is still not fast enough. "Many people are trapped in their homes." "In our village, 300 to 400 people are just lying helplessly on the street with nowhere to go." The Prime Minister of Mozambique said that the exact death toll in Mozambique has reached 293, "and we believe that this number will continue to rise." The United Nations said that among the other two severely affected countries, the death toll in Zimbabwe reached 259, and Malawi had 56, for a total of 608; in addition, the total number of people affected in the three countries of Eastern and Southern Africa was about 170. Thousands of people. Because disaster relief workers have not yet been able to advance to distant disaster-stricken areas, the speed of message transmission is slow, and the government and the more severely affected areas are still unable to establish communication links. The president of Mozambique said, "All indications are that our death toll may definitely exceed 1,000." Some experts even think this number is too conservative. Even for those who are rescued, it is sad to have their loved ones separated. An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) representative said: "It is indescribable to be in the middle of a disaster as severe as Cyclone Idai and not know where your family is suffering." The ICRC is continuing to dispatch personnel to assist victims who do not have access to telephones or the Internet to find their relatives. Want to read more news?

Due to Taiwan’s advanced deployment and the cooperation between the government and the people, the epidemic has gradually stabilized. However, the epidemic situation in other countries is still severe. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Tzu Chi has continued to provide assistance and care, providing anti-epidemic materials and care to first responders, vulnerable families, and people in need, including distributing charity rice provided by the Taiwan Council of Agriculture to Mo San Bic, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Lion Rock in South Africa, Haiti, Honduras, St. Maarten, Cambodia and other countries, the love from Taiwan followed the fragrance of rice to other countries.

Many people who originally relied on odd jobs and overseas migrant workers have lost their jobs during this wave of epidemics. Local Tzu Chi volunteers are also taking safety precautions and combining government efforts to provide food and epidemic prevention material assistance to countries in Asia and Africa. In Asia, Tzu Chi volunteers in Myanmar were worried that poor families would run out of food due to unemployment. In early May, before the rainy season came, they visited rural areas with Taiwanese charity rice. Many poor people have exhausted their rice storage boxes at home and have even borrowed money to buy rice every day. Tzu Chi distributed 48 kilograms of rice and 2 liters of cooking oil to each household. The locals happily said that it can feed their family of five for a month. ▼Tzu Chi volunteers in Myanmar visited poor families in rural areas and provided rice and cooking oil to a 91-year-old grandmother. In Africa, after the first case was diagnosed in Mozambique on March 22, the local government assessed that most people did not have TVs and mobile phones at home, had not even heard of the new coronavirus, and were unable to obtain epidemic prevention information. They asked Tzu Chi volunteers to help carry out epidemic prevention propaganda. Health education.

The first officially confirmed cases of cholera were registered in the city of Beira, which was heavily damaged by the devastating Cyclone Idai. According to Mozambican health authorities, all the cases are residents of the poor urban district of Munhava. The possibility of a cholera outbreak is a major concern for hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors who are forced to cope without clean water or sanitation. The disease, which can be fatal within hours of infection, is spread through contaminated food and water. According to Reuters, Mozambican authorities are organizing cholera prevention and treatment centers in areas affected by the cyclone. Earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the humanitarian crisis in African countries, provoked by Cyclone Idai, could lead to an outbreak of a number of dangerous diseases, including cholera. According to the latest data, as a result of floods caused by Cyclone Idai, 447 people were killed and 1.5 thousand were injured in Mozambique. The consequences of the natural disaster affected 531 thousand residents of the country, about 33.6 thousand houses were damaged and destroyed. -0-\nDocument [2]: The Catholic Church in Malawi (South Africa) provides assistance to victims of natural disaster About a million people in the country were affected by floods and rainfall caused by the Idai cyclone.

This was reported by RFI Kiswahili with reference to a statement by the regional head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP). “The threat of hunger has reached unprecedented levels and there are fears that the situation will continue to worsen,” warned WFP South Africa head Lola Castro. Southern Africa has suffered severe rainfall shortages over the past five years, she said, caused by El Niño, a fluctuating surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that has a marked effect on the climate. Prolonged droughts have destroyed crops in 16 countries in the region, many of which are among the world's poorest countries. Castro added that in addition to drought, climate change provokes the emergence of destructive typhoons and hurricanes. Thus, in 2019, Cyclone Idai caused serious floods in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, during which hundreds of people died and millions of people in the region were left without shelter and livelihoods.\nDocument [8]: The Federation Council approved punishment for the leaders of organized crime groups: Yandex.News Current Art. 210 of the Criminal Code, the president will add a new part 1.1 - it provides for liability for “participation in a meeting of organizers, leaders or other representatives of criminal communities or organized groups.” Punishment - from 12 to 20 years in prison.

Travelers were waiting for a ferry at a pier in Tanzania - it took them to Mozambique. A traveler from Novosibirsk and organizer of a round-the-world expedition, Alexey Kamerzanov, set off on a journey again - this time to Africa. His first target was Mozambique in the southeastern part of the continent. “Right before we left, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi were hit by tropical storm Idai. Mozambique was especially hard hit, some towns and villages went under water, epidemics of typhoid and cholera began, and some roads were closed. At some point the question arose whether to go to Mozambique or not. We had three options to get to Mozambique from Tanzania. We chose the most difficult and unpredictable one: to take a ferry across the Ruvuma River. What added poignancy was the fact that those places were restless,” Alexey Kamerzanov told an NGS correspondent. According to the traveler, the pier is very colorful - “several thatched shacks, a lot of people and a lot of dirt.” According to Kamerzanov, for several weeks they corresponded with the ferry captain to make sure that they would definitely be able to cross and would not get stuck on the Tanzanian coast. The local population at the Tanzanian pier prefers motorized transport. While waiting for the ferry, Alexey Kamerzanov took pictures with local residents. But it turned out that in the morning the ferry tried to cross the river, but almost ran aground in the middle of the journey. And the travelers had to wait for a high tide. “As soon as the ferry started loading, it all turned into hell. Not surprising, because some had already been waiting for the ferry for three days. Cars that arrived before us began trying to enter at the same time. There was an uproar, screams, squeals, and two accidents occurred in five minutes. While the culprits were figuring out what and how, Akhmed (the captain of the ferry - editor's note) nodded to us: "Come on now, all the cars." We just flew onto the ferry between two cars that were stuck in a showdown,” explained Alexey Kamerzanov. The loaded ferry almost ran aground. Kamerzanov set off on a trip to Mozambique in a Toyota SUV. As soon as the cars left the ferry at their destination, they got stuck in the mud. “Even walking through the slippery black soil, abundantly watered by tropical downpours, was not easy. The locals have a simple business: show the way where the car would “accidentally” fall into the mud, and for $100 help in pulling it out. It was decided to do everything ourselves,” the traveler noted. It all took them half an hour: “The picture came out epic: night, frogs screaming, reeds taller than a man, locals scurrying and screaming everywhere, it’s raining, our first Hilux unsuccessfully slides into the mud. A real mud off-road begins, with a winch and lowering the wheels,” Kamerzanov described. Driving at night was prohibited - border guards did not\nDocument [10]: Floods kill 280 in East Africa - UN Nairobi, , 12:23 - REGNUM At least 280 people have died and more than 2.8 million others have been affected by heavy rains and floods in eastern Africa. This was reported by Daily Monitor Uganda with reference to a message from the UN humanitarian agency. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the homes and infrastructure of millions of people in the region had been destroyed, their livelihoods had been destroyed, and the risk of outbreaks of infectious diseases, including cholera, was growing in the hardest-hit areas. “Mainly due to the Indian Ocean Dipole, heavy rainfall is likely to continue into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,” OCHA said in a report on flash floods in East Africa. According to the report, the disaster caused destruction and damage to key infrastructure in Kenya, including homes, health facilities and schools, resulting in the death of 132 people. Roads and bridges were damaged, hampering an effective humanitarian response in the affected areas. The report also said Djibouti received two years' worth of rainfall in one day, causing flash floods that affected up to 250,000 people, including nine deaths. “In many areas, floods occur against the backdrop of successive droughts, while in other regions, flood-affected people are also suffering from conflict and violence,” OCHA said. “As families struggle to cope with increasing difficulties, there is a serious risk that they will adopt negative coping mechanisms, including school dropout and early marriage,” the UN warned. Flooding in Somalia has affected 547,000 people, including some 370,000 displaced and 17 deaths, according to OCHA. In South Sudan, where 908,000 people have been affected by floods since June, flooding has affected entire communities, destroyed or rendered basic services and markets unavailable, and caused crop losses. The UN also said more than 420,000 people were affected by the August 3 October floods in Sudan, which killed 78 people and destroyed 49,500 homes. In Ethiopia, some 570,000 people were affected, including more than 200,000 displaced, and rains negatively impacted the harvest season. In Burundi, OCHA said 3,100 people were affected by heavy rains in Muninga province, while in Uganda, floods and landslides affected at least 12 districts, including Bundibuyo district, where more than 4,000 people were affected. In Tanzania, according to the UN, the death toll exceeds 50 people, including 10 people who drowned in a river that overflowed its banks.\n\nReport:

The steeple building and the famous rose window were burned. Although the rescuers' efforts successfully prevented the fire from spreading, the main building and the two tower structures were saved, but a large number of people were injured. The French people were heartbroken and shed tears as they watched their beloved symbol of France fall into flames. A serious fire broke out in the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris in France on the evening of the 15th. The fire spread rapidly and mercilessly engulfed the roof of the cathedral. Thick smoke filled the sky over Paris. After the authorities learned about it, they immediately dispatched 400 firefighters to put out the fire. However, due to the intensity of the fire, it was difficult to directly approach the main source of the fire at first, and the rescue operation was temporarily hindered. Fortunately, after more than 4 hours of rescue, the fire was successfully controlled and prevented from spreading to the North Bell Tower. The overall structure of Notre Dame Cathedral was preserved. Although the sacred relics in Notre Dame, including the Crown of Thorns and the Robe of Saint Louis, were rescued immediately, the spire and roof structure of Notre Dame were burned and collapsed by the fire, and the famous rose window was also destroyed. After it was burned down, a large number of French people gathered around the scene, prayed silently, shed tears, and some even knelt down to pray on the spot. Many churches around Paris also rang bells to pay tribute, hoping to help Notre Dame survive the crisis. Foreign media sources pointed out that Notre Dame has continued to be renovated recently, and scaffolding has been erected in some areas. However, regarding the cause of the fire, the local fire brigade only stated that it may be related to the repair project, but the exact cause still needs further investigation.

The restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral is being done with the help of 833 million euros of funds collected from domestic and foreign campaigns, but this alone is not enough to complete the work. 70 million euros of this funding came from outside France and half of it was provided by the United States. . Currently, about one thousand hand-picked oaks have been dedicated to the reconstruction of the minaret and arm of Notre Dame. What was the cause of the fire? Along with hundreds of experts who are looking to secure and restore the Notre Dame Cathedral, a group is also trying to clarify the cause of the fire two years ago. In this regard, within two months, 100 eyewitnesses were interrogated. The several-month process of gathering evidence has already ended and according to one of the knowledgeable sources, the work of analyzing and examining the evidence will begin soon. So far, several security weaknesses of the church have been identified, among which we can mention the disruption in the fire alarm system and the power cut of one of the building's elevators. Although probably an accident such as a connection of electric wires or a lit cigarette butt caused the fire in this cathedral, the extent of the damage made it difficult to conclude about this. The Notre Dame Cathedral fire from the camera frame Although it is still not clear what exactly happened on the night of the fire, filmmakers have already started making film and television adaptations of this event. Netflix, one of the giants of the internet broadcasting industry, is preparing to make a six-part mini-series that depicts the impact of this fire on the people of France.

The Mars Helicopter "Ingenuity" successfully flew. April 19, 2021, is definitely a memorable day in the history of aerospace. NASA's Mars Helicopter "Ingenuity" completed its first flight. This is an aircraft made by humans. The first successful powered flight on another planet proved that aerodynamics and aviation lift still apply even in a place as thin as Mars. Space News reported that the cost of Ingenuity was US$85 million. It was equipped with a black-and-white camera and a 13-million-color color imager, but there were no redundant scientific instruments because its job was very simple. To prove that feats of flight to extraterrestrial planets are possible. Perseverance captured Ingenuity's flight. (Picture/NASA) The gravity of Mars is only 35% of Earth's, so the lift required for flight is not large. However, the Martian atmosphere is only 1% of Earth's, making the lift caused by stirring the air very weak. Before the flight of Ingenuity, scientists were not sure whether Ingenuity's coaxial twin propellers could successfully lift the entire helicopter. You wouldn't believe what I just saw.

Then it flew 39.1 seconds after Landing. Video of Nasa Mars Ingenuity helicopter's successful first flight on Red Planet. The footage of this first flight includes the part taken by Ingenuity itself. Its black-and-white camera recorded its flight process, and the shadow of the propeller was projected on the surface of Mars. In addition, the Perseverance mother vehicle also captured the flight dynamics of Ingenuity from 65 meters away. When the photos were sent back to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the personnel on site clapped their hands excitedly. MiMi Aung, JPL's Ingenuity Group Director, said: "We can now say that humans have successfully flown on Mars, and the aircraft we invented has taken off, sailed and landed stably on another planet. I can appreciate how proud the Wright brothers were of their first flight." This flight is the first of five planned flights for the Ingenuity. Subsequent flights will be more challenging and are planned to reach a flight altitude of 5 meters. , and longer flight distances. NASA believes that after proving that flight on Mars is possible, future alien missions will not only move in planes, but also add a third dimension. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science, said: "Flight will be a new exploration tool in the future." Future missions to Mars have not yet envisioned airplanes or rotorcraft. However, in the plan to detect Saturn's largest moon, Titan, there is a "Dragonfly Project", which is to send an unmanned aircraft to fly on Titan. With the dense atmosphere, it should be able to fly very quickly. All goes well, Dragonfly is scheduled to be launched in 2027.

After NASA's "Ingenuity" successfully took off on the 19th, it instantly photographed the surface of Mars and its own shadow, becoming the first unmanned helicopter's alien sky seen by humans. Photograph. (Getty Images) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) unmanned helicopter "Ingenuity" completed its first flight on the surface of Mars on the 19th. The solar-powered Ingenuity took off from the surface, lifted three meters from the ground, and stayed in the air for 40 seconds. Landed smoothly; this is another human feat since the invention of the aircraft by the Wright brothers in 1903, achieving controlled powered flight in space from one planet to another; the Ingenuity successfully made its first flight, laying the foundation for future exploration. Mars and other planets in the solar system usher in a new era of flight. Data transmitted back from Mars showed that the 1.8-kilogram Ingenuity made its 40-second maiden flight as planned; a team of engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California announced: "The altimeter data confirms "The Ingenuity helicopter has completed its first flight. This is a powered aircraft's maiden voyage on another planet." The control room burst into cheers. "Now we can say that humans have flown an aircraft on another planet," said Mimi Aung, director of JPL's Mars Helicopter Program. Equipped with a photographic lens, one black and white lens points downward and has both shooting and navigation functions, and the other high-quality color lens can capture horizontal scenes. NASA live broadcasted the test flight and displayed the first photos sent back by Ingenuity. A black-and-white photo showed Ingenuity in the air. The onboard camera clearly captured the shadow of the helicopter on the surface of Mars, making it the first unmanned helicopter photo ever seen by humans. Taking photos of alien skies. In addition, the Mars exploration rover "Perseverance" parked about 200 meters away also captured a short color video, showing Ingenuity flying with orange scenery around it. The "Perseverance" rover captured a short color video, which shows the "Ingenuity" flying above the surface of Mars, surrounded by orange scenery. (Reuters) Ingenuity was originally scheduled to fly for the first time on the 11th, but NASA discovered potential problems during a high-speed test of the rotor and postponed the first flight. The air on Mars is thin, and the atmospheric pressure is less than 1% of Earth’s. Ingenuity’s rotor must rotate You have to go faster to get enough upward momentum. A small piece of fabric from Wright's maiden flight was also sent to Mars. NASA said that to commemorate this landmark first flight into outer space, engineers attached a small piece of fabric from the wings of the Wright brothers' first test aircraft under the solar panel of Ingenuity and sent it to Mars. Mars, a tribute to the Wright brothers. Although the flight time of this mission is very short, it still represents a historic feat of interstellar navigation; the distance between the Earth\nDocument [3]: A giant step forward for mankind, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter successfully made its first flight on Mars. Based on the data and images transmitted back to Earth, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) "Ingenuity Mars Helicopter" successfully made its first flight on Mars today. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Agence France-Presse reported that an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced, "Altimeter data confirms that the Innovation helicopter has completed its first flight, the first time a powered aircraft has flown on another planet." "Flight", the control room burst into cheers. A short video sent back by the Mars exploration rover "Perseverance" showed that the 1.8-kilogram helicopter hovered 3 meters above the surface of Mars and then landed. Innovation was originally scheduled to fly for the first time on the 11th, but NASA discovered potential problems during high-speed testing of the rotor, thus delaying the first flight. NASA said this unprecedented mission of Innovation is extremely risky and a major challenge because the Martian air is thin and the atmospheric pressure is less than 1% of that of Earth.

It is of epoch-making significance. "We now officially announce that humans can already fly rotorcraft on another planet!" Mimi Aung, the project manager of "Ingenuity" announced the successful test flight of the drone on Mars. When NASA received photos and videos from Mars a few hours later, the staff at the ground control center applauded and cheered. The air is as thin as the earth at an altitude of 30,000 meters. The preset autonomous flight "Smart" rose to about three meters in the air, hovered for a while and then returned to the ground. A flight of only a few dozen seconds may seem insignificant, but it is an important milestone in the history of human science. Weng Mimi said: "Every planet can only fly once." In 1903, the Wright brothers achieved the first human flight in 12 seconds. "Ingenuity" even specially carried scraps of wing cloth from the Wright brothers' propeller aircraft to Mars to pay tribute to the two pioneers of flight. The "Ingenuity" was originally scheduled to take off on April 11, but due to software problems, it was delayed for eight days before taking off. NASA chose to test the flight at noon when the Martian winds are the mildest. The density of the atmosphere on the surface of Mars is only one percent of that of the Earth, which is equivalent to the Earth's altitude of 30,000 meters. The thinner the air, the harder it is to control a propeller aircraft. Helicopters on Earth have never challenged this record. NASA's Mars exploration rover "Perseverance" monitors and photographs the whole process from 65 meters away. When "Ingenuity" returns to the ground, it transmits the data collected during the test flight to "Perseverance", and then "Perseverance" sends it back to Earth. The 1.8-kilogram, US$85 million (HK$663 million) "Ingenuity" was charged with solar energy immediately after landing to ensure that the insulation system can continue to operate and resist the Martian cold environment that can drop to -90°C at any time at night. After the success of this test flight, NASA plans to arrange "Ingenuity" to conduct up to five flight missions in the next month, with the difficulty, altitude, and range gradually increasing. At present, humans mainly rely on unmanned four-wheel drive vehicles to explore the surfaces of other stars, but "Ingenuity" will bring revolutionary changes, allowing NASA to use aerial photography to survey terrain that was difficult to reach by four-wheel drive vehicles in the past. Reuters/AFP\nDocument [5]: The Innovation Helicopter's third test flight to Mars went faster and further this time - Technology NASA's mini-helicopter "Ingenuity" successfully completed its third trip to Mars today, and this time it flew further , the speed is also faster than the previous two times, with the fastest speed reaching 2 meters per second. Agence France-Presse reported that Innovation's first two flights hovered above the surface of the red planet. This latest flight has a distance of 50 meters and a speed of 2 meters per second. Dave Lavery, executive director of the Innovation program, said: "Today's flight was just as we planned, but it was still full of surprises." The Perseverance Mars Exploration Rover also captured the 80-second third flight of Innovation. NASA said today that the video will be sent back to Earth in the next few days. This horizontal flight was to test the automatic navigation system of Innovation and complete the flight route based on the information received in advance. NASA said in a statement about the mission: "If Innovation flies too fast, the flight algorithm will not be able to track the surface features of Mars." The Innovation mission is challenging because the Martian environment is very different from that of Earth, which is the most difficult. The only thing is that the atmosphere is thin and the atmospheric pressure is less than 1% of that of the earth. This means that the 122-centimeter-long rotor of Innovation must reach 2,400 revolutions per minute to rise, which is about five times that of helicopters on Earth. NASA announced that it is preparing to launch its fourth mission. In order to test the limits of Innovation, the team will increase the difficulty of each planned flight. The Innovation experiment will end within one month, allowing Perseverance to return to its main mission: exploring traces of ancient microbial life on Mars.

Mrs. Ang is referring to Wilbur and Orville Wright, who in 1903 successfully made the first flight with a motorized and controllable airplane. Flying on Mars is not an easy task due to the characteristics of the red planet's atmosphere, and the density of its atmosphere is only one percent of Earth's atmosphere. This issue makes it difficult to engage the blades of the helicopter, which is necessary to lift it off the ground. For this reason, Ingenuity UAV is made very light and weighs only 1.8 kg. NASA launched Ingenuity with the Perseverance Rover, which landed on the Red Planet in February.\nDocument [2]: NASA has revealed the date of the first flight on Mars. Sputnik reports that the helicopter survived the first cold night on the Red Planet, where the temperature reaches minus 90 degrees Celsius. Initially, the first Mars helicopter weighed only 1.8 kg, which was carried inside the Perseverance rover. Ingenuity was separated from the rover and launched into an impact crater on Mars called Jezero. In March, the Perseverance rover touched down on Mars for the first time. The total travel time of the robot was 33 minutes. During this time, the robot traveled 6.5 meters: 4 meters forward and another 2.5 meters after turning 150 degrees. So scientists tested the rover's equipment for further calibration of its systems. According to NASA, this robot has given a very good response to the construction teams.\nDocument [3]: Ingenuity will experience its fourth Mars flight today. This afternoon at 18:42, NASA wants to make its fourth Mars helicopter flight with a greater distance and speed than its previous flights. According to Isna and quoted by Engjet, NASA's "Ingenuity" helicopter, which is the first human extraterrestrial aviator to fly on a planet other than Earth, made its first flight on Monday, April 30 (April 19). In this flight, this helicopter took a straight vertical path and in this flight, which lasted for 39 seconds, it reached a height of three meters above the surface of Mars. Then, three days later, "Genius" experienced the second flight on the morning of Thursday, April 22, for 52 seconds and separated 4.8 meters from the surface of Mars. Finally, on Sunday, May 5 (April 25), this helicopter successfully completed its third and boldest flight over Mars, and the rover "Istiqamat" that supports it, recorded and released a video of this moment. The Nabogh helicopter started its third flight at 10:00 a.m. Iran time and reached a height of 4.8 meters above the surface of Mars, then traveled a distance of 50 meters equivalent to half a football field and reached a maximum speed of two meters per second. After that, "genius" returned to his original place and set the record for 100 meters distance in 80 seconds. Now, it is scheduled to complete its fourth flight out of five planned flights today, Thursday, April 9 (April 29) at 18:42 Iran time. In the third flight of this helicopter, the "genius" operation team fulfilled three necessary goals for the success of this pilot project. Now, for its fourth test flight, the mission team wants to push the copter's performance limits on Mars, even if it means crashing, by flying it faster over a greater distance to pass more rocks and impact craters. The flights of this extraterrestrial helicopter were planned 6 years ago after it was flown in a pod at NASA's JPL laboratory. "When Genius landed after its third flight, we knew we had collected more than enough information to help engineers design the next generation of Mars helicopters," said Bob Balaram, Genius' chief engineer. Now we plan to extend the range, speed and flight duration of this helicopter to gain more insight into its performance. For the fourth flight, the Operation Ingenuity team wants to move about 84 meters from its origin and hover at the same altitude of 16 feet (4.87 meters). They will also increase the flight time of "Genius" from 80 seconds to 117 seconds, and its maximum speed will increase from 2 m/s to 3.57 m/s. NASA expects the first set of data from the flight at 9:51 p.m. today, so we won't have to wait long to find out if the fourth flight was a success. While the operations team is already brainstorming ideas for a fifth flight, it is working to realize its goals for a fourth flight.

According to NASA's report, this small device (the size of a toaster) installed on the rover has been able to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. According to these reports, this amount of oxygen is enough for an astronaut to breathe for ten minutes. Almost all the atmosphere of Mars consists of carbon monoxide. NASA says this development paves the way for the production of oxygen and its use in launching spacecraft from the surface of the planet, as well as providing breathable oxygen. The US space agency has emphasized that this technology is an important step to send the first human to Mars.

This probe reached Mars after a seven-month journey. The signal indicating that the rover was on Mars reached the control room at 20:55 GMT. According to the distance of Mars from Earth, it takes about 11 minutes for the message to be transmitted between Earth and this rover. A few days ago, NASA announced that the micro-helicopter "Ingenuity" flew on the surface of this planet for the first time. The little helicopter's flight time was about 40 seconds, but NASA says it's celebrating the first controlled flight of an airship in "another world."

Although this helicopter made of metal cable and steel flew for only 39.1 seconds at a height of three meters and then fell on the surface of Mars, but the short flight on Monday is considered a big step in this field according to space experts. Commercial advertisement for Ingenuity's helicopter trail, which undoubtedly made a name for itself with its short flight over Mars as the first human-made space traveler to take off from another planet, is a light device that weighs only 1.8 kilos and 1. Its size is 2 meters. This helicopter is made with two biplane wings, each rotating in the opposite direction. The rotation speed of the wings is 2,400 to 2,900 rotations per minute, which is ten times that of ground helicopters. However, this rotation speed is unavoidable to fly the helicopter considering that the concentration of the Martian atmosphere is only 1% of the Earth's atmosphere.

According to the reporter of the technology portal of the virtual space group of the Young Journalists Club, NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter successfully completed its mission and recorded an important milestone in the history of the research of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA's Ingenuity helicopter has flown a total of one mile on Mars. The 10th flight of this plane was also its most complicated flight to date. According to engadget, the Ingenuity helicopter crossed the one-mile mark for total distance traveled 10 minutes into its flight on July 24, when it passed through the "Raid Ridges" area of ​​Jizerou Crater. That might not sound like a long flight, but NASA only had a few test flights planned for Ingenuity before expanding its role, and the robotic plane wouldn't have covered nearly as much planetary space without those missions. NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter mission is also the most ambitious flight to date. The helicopter had to traverse 10 different stations and fly 40 feet each time during the 310-foot journey. It has also captured enough images to help NASA with future research, and by sending it back to Earth, it has helped the Perseverance rover's potential missions. It is not known how many more miles the genius can continue to fly. This helicopter is the first of its kind and tends to discover new information with each new flight and create a window for further projects. The great thing about NASA's electric plane is that the one-mile flight threshold is significant in itself, and that suggests the plane may achieve a lot during Perserverance's planned two-year mission and possibly beyond. In the following, you can see a video of the genius helicopter flight: read more at the end of the message/\nDocument [7]: The latest news about NASA's rover activity on the surface of Mars + video According to Sputnik, the first test flight of the Ingenuity unmanned helicopter will take place on or after April 8. During the first launch, the helicopter rises to a height of about 3 meters, hovers above the ground for 30 seconds, rotates around its axis in place, and then lands. According to the program that NASA engineers send to the helicopter's computer the day before the flight, the whole process is done automatically. The 0.5-megapixel camera on the bottom of the device takes 30 photos per second during this process (that is, it actually records video). Also, this helicopter has a better 13 megapixel camera that is directed towards the horizon. When the helicopter is in the air, he checks the surroundings. In turn, the "Perseverance" rover equipped with several cameras will record the flight of the Martian helicopter from the surface of the Red Planet. Then all the photos are sent to Earth. It is a rover probe designed for use in NASA's Mars 2020 mission. This rover was launched on July 30, 2020 for the Mars orbiting mission and landed on Mars on February 19, 2021. The rover left for Mars from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The landing site of the Mars rover "Istiqamat" is considered to be the Martian crater of Jizero. The Endurance rover, which is the size of a car, is equipped with seven scientific instruments to study the surface of Mars in the Jizera crater. The equipment of the Endurance rover has a total of 23 cameras, two microphones, and an oxygen supply device.\nDocument [8]: The fourth flight of NASA's helicopter on Mars was not carried out. According to Sputnik, referring to the note published by NASA on Twitter, on April 29 (Thursday), NASA could not fly the Ingenuity helicopter on the surface of Mars. Due to the unsuccessful flight of the "Marsian Genius Helicopter" over Mars, the team of experts evaluated the information and data and plans to make another attempt in the near future. It is worth noting that some time ago, NASA successfully flew the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars for the third time to test the helicopter in more complex conditions. Also, in this small flight, the Ingenuity helicopter has published photos of the surface of Mars, which are very interesting in their own way. In this flight, NASA tested the Ingenuity helicopter far beyond previous tests. In this flight, the helicopter flew at the same height compared to the previous test (5 meters), but at a speed 4 times higher than the previous test (2 meters per second versus 0.5 meters per second in the previous test) and flew for a much longer distance. . On this flight, NASA moved Ingenuity 50 meters north (more than half the length of a football field) and the helicopter returned another 50 meters to land where it took off. NASA's Perseverance rover took the Ingenuity helicopter with it to Mars on February 18 this year, and NASA expects that with multiple flights of this helicopter, it will obtain comprehensive information about the state and soil of Mars and use them for future space missions. take Aim high, and fly, fly again. The #MarsHelicopter's ambitious fourth flight did not get off the ground, but the team is assessing the data and will aim to try again soon. We'll keep you posted. https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE pic.twitter.com/HDaF0fAILs — NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) April 29, 2021 Ingenuity microhelicopter weighs one kilo and eight hundred grams and cost NASA 85 million dollars and is one of the ideas It is considered new in space exploration. These helicopters can reach other spheres more and faster than surfacers.\nDocument [9]: The successful flight of NASA's helicopter on Mars The American space agency, NASA, has succeeded in flying a small helicopter on Mars for the first time. The mini-helicopter "Ingenuity" (Ingenuity) is the first controllable motor device to fly on a planet other than Earth and is designed for a more detailed and extensive study of the planet Mars. It is very difficult to fly a helicopter on Mars, because the air density on this planet is only one tenth of the Earth's atmosphere, and for the helicopter to take off, a very high speed of rotation of the propellers and a very low weight are needed. The rotation speed of the propellers of this helicopter is over 2,500 revolutions per minute. On Monday, April 30, NASA announced that this small helicopter flew for less than a minute and its information was transmitted to the ground by the "Peshtkar" rover. A week ago, the test flight of this helicopter was supposed to be carried out, but due to what was announced as a "technical fault", this flight was assigned to Monday, and more flights are scheduled to be carried out by this helicopter in the future. NASA has likened the flight of "genius" to the success of the first flight of the Wright brothers, the inventors of the first controllable motorized airplane; But this time the flight happened on the planet Mars. The study of the Red Planet has become one of the important goals of the space agencies of countries, especially the United States, the European Union, and China. China's National Space Agency announced on February 22 last year that the country's "Tianwen-1" Mars rover has entered the orbit of the Red Planet after six and a half months of launch by the "Changzhen 5" rocket. This is China's first independent project to send a spacecraft to the surface of Mars. A day before that, a probe from the United Arab Emirates had reached Mars. China and Russia had previously unsuccessfully attempted to send a spacecraft to Mars in 2011. Part of Mars surface studies is searching for possible traces of life on this planet billions of years ago; Although it is expected that perhaps only primitive life at the multicellular level existed in the distant past of this planet.

This small 1.8 kg helicopter called "Ingenuity" is a part of the Perseverance rover that landed in a crater called Jezero more than a month ago. The rover will attempt a series of short flights through the thin air of Mars. NASA said that a piece of fabric the size of a postage stamp from the wing of the Wright brothers' plane was attached to the helicopter. This helicopter is still attached to the rover. At the end of the week, its protective cover was removed, and the helicopter will be put down in the coming days. Engineers have identified an area of ​​ten meters by ten meters on the island, which they call an "airfield". This point is at the end of a 90-meter "flight zone" along which Ingenuity will likely conduct several test flights. At the same time, Perseverance will try to take photos or even video of the helicopter's flights, which will be difficult, of course. Ingenuity is too light to fly in the thin atmosphere of Mars. This helicopter is equipped with four carbon fiber blades, which are placed in the form of two one-meter propellers that rotate in two different directions. They rotate at a speed of 2,400 revolutions per minute, which is much faster than passenger helicopters on the ground. image copyrightNASA/JPL-CALTECH image captionA small piece of Wright Brothers airplane fabric is attached to the underside of the helicopter's solar panel He should remain fixed in the sky, go around and then sit down. If this part is successful, more complex flights will be tested in the next phase. Laurie Gillies, director of planetary science at NASA, said the helicopter could pave the way for exploratory flights. "Can we photograph places that cannot be seen from space or that the rover can't reach? Can a helicopter survey the exploration area for the rover in advance and help determine the best route and the best possible place to study?" Can we help future human missions by having the ability to fly? "These are questions whose answers are not clear today, but the demonstration of technological capabilities allows us to be creative and test new capabilities." NASA has approved a mission called Dragonfly for the 2030s, which will use a robotic bird to fly above the surface of Titan, the moon of Saturn. The Soviet Union was the first country to launch an instrument into the skies of another planet in the 1980s, when the Vega balloons flew through the atmosphere of Venus.\n\nReport:

The start of neutrino research on Lake Baikal is one of the central events of the Year of Science and Technology in Russia. One of the priority tasks of the Year of Science and Technology in Russia is to attract young people into research activities, as well as to develop science, technology and higher education in Russian regions. Here, on Baikal, in a unique place, world-class science is developing - our best scientific institutes and universities, including regional ones, have joined forces in the Baikal Deep-Sea Neutrino Telescope project,” noted the head of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science Valery Falkov at the launch ceremony. The minister noted the importance of this kind of large-scale projects for attracting young people into the field of research and development: “Science is one of the drivers of territorial development. The problem in many regions is that young people choose large agglomerations, cities, and metropolitan universities as their place of residence. In order for young people to have an incentive to develop in their homeland, projects like the ones we are launching today in the Irkutsk region are needed. Young people will be able to participate in scientific research and engineering and technological work at an advanced level, make discoveries, learn, thereby increasing the scientific and technological potential of their region and our entire country. “I am grateful to our colleagues from major institutes, from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who have been very actively working on Lake Baikal for several years now.” The Baikal Neutrino Telescope is a unique international project. And we need to involve the educational and scientific potential of the Irkutsk region in it. For young scientists who are concerned about the conservation of Lake Baikal, working on this project can be a serious practical experience. Irkutsk today is becoming a center of fundamental science, and we are interested in ensuring that scientific potential remains in the region,” emphasized Igor Kobzev, Governor of the Irkutsk Region. The event was also attended by the director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna) Grigory Trubnikov, the director of the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences Maxim Libanov, and the rector of Irkutsk State University Alexander Schmidt. Telescope The deep-sea neutrino telescope on Lake Baikal has been built since 2015 by the international collaboration BAIKAL-GVD. The co-executors of the Baikal-GVD project include the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Irkutsk State University, and Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University. The project participants are the Institute of Experimental and Applied Physics of the Czech Technical University (Czech Republic), Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics of Comenius University (Slovakia), EvoLogiсs Gmbh (Germany), Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences (Poland). This year, with the commissioning\nDocument [2]: The largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere was put into operation on Baikal The largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere was put into operation on Baikal 03.13.2021, 9:26, News of the day ✔ Subscribe to our Telegram channel “News without censorship” - t.me/ryb24 The largest deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, Baikal-GVD, built on Lake Baikal, was put into operation on Saturday, said Russian Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery Falkov. According to Falkov, this “allows us to count on the fact that the discoveries that will be made and the information that will be processed will allow us to solve many scientific problems,” TASS reports. “In particular, we expect that our colleagues will still make their contribution; together we will understand how the Universe works, read the history of the Universe, how galaxies were born,” the minister added. He noted that this is also important for the region, since science is one of the drivers of regional development. Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Grigory Trubnikov said that “with the launch of the Baikal telescope, we absolutely immediately become world leaders in the field of research into the properties of neutrinos.” “Baikal will be the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, and the start of research on it is another triumph for Russian science and international scientific cooperation,” he added. According to the academician, the telescope will make it possible to “record neutrino statistics that are an order of magnitude better than was possible in previous years”: “With the help of Baikal, we will be able to detect much more high-energy particles than before, and we will even register particles that were born earlier,” than the solar system. This will allow us to better understand the birth, development and structure of the Universe. We plan to complete the build-out of new telescope clusters in early April.” Neutrinos are one of the elementary particles that appear as a result of nuclear reactions and have phenomenal penetrating ability. In the mid-1930s, scientists calculated that neutrinos with energies of a few megaelectronvolts interact so weakly with matter that they can overcome a layer of liquid hydrogen a thousand light years thick. In 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which prove that neutrinos have mass. The megascience-class installation “Baikal Deep-Sea Neutrino Telescope” has been built since 2015 at the 106th km of the Circum-Baikal Railway on Lake Baikal by the international collaboration Baikal-GVD. The installation is being constructed under the patronage of researchers from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna) and the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow), with important contributions from scientists and engineers from Russian research centers and foreign researchers, in particular from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. The main goals of the neutrino telescope are to detect sources of ultra-high-energy neutrinos and study the evolution of galaxies and the Universe. It will also become the basis for the development of neutrino astronomy\nDocument [3]: The installation of the next clusters of the deep-sea neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD has been completed. Irkutsk, 04/13/20 (IA “Teleinform”), - Last week, the international scientific collaboration “Baikal”, a key participant of which is the Research Institute of Applied Physics of ISU, completed the installation of the next clusters of a unique scientific installation in Russia – Baikal-GVD deep-sea neutrino telescope. The press service of the university reports this. – During this expedition, the sixth and seventh clusters of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope were installed. Next year it is planned to deploy two more clusters, and this will complete the creation of the first stage of the telescope. In the future, it can be increased several times more,” noted physicist scientist, head of the laboratory of astrophysics of elementary particles and gamma astronomy of the Research Institute of Applied Physics of ISU Nikolai Budnev. Now all seven clusters are combined into a single system for collecting and processing data, and the equipment of the entire complex is being checked and configured. The Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope is designed to detect weak flashes of light (Cherenkov radiation) that arise as a result of the interaction of particles coming from space (neutrinos) with water. Neutrino streams are born in the most distant and powerful energy sources - these are, for example, supernova explosions or active galactic nuclei. Accordingly, neutrinos are a unique carrier of information. Professor Nikolai Budnev emphasized that “in general, this is necessary to understand the history of the origin of the Universe, its development, its current state and what will happen to it in the future, and this gives humanity an understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, the fundamental laws of the structure of the Universe.” The university notes that previously installed clusters have been working since their final deployment. The results of processing the data obtained showed that the telescope can detect high-energy neutrinos. REFERENCE: The telescope consists of independent structural units called clusters. Each of the clusters consists of 288 optical detectors connected in eight garlands and immersed in the bottom of Lake Baikal. Design of a neutrino telescope with a volume of about a cubic kilometer, called Baikal-GVD, began in 2010-2011. The first cluster of the installation reached its design capacity in 2016. The second cluster was deployed in 2017, and the third in 2018. In 2019, taking into account the developments, scientists managed to install two clusters at once; this experience was successfully repeated this year. Work on the neutrino telescope project is being carried out by a large international collaboration, the main participants in which are the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna), Irkutsk State University, Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov.\nDocument [4]: The largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere began operating on Baikal. The largest deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, Baikal-GVD, began operating on Baikal. TASS reports this. It is noted that this telescope will help detect sources of ultra-high energy neutrinos, as well as study the evolution of galaxies and the Universe. According to the director of the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences Maxim Libanov, 2.5 billion rubles were spent on the construction of the project, the installation occupies an area of ​​​​about 0.5 square meters. km. Over time it will be supplemented. Director of JINR (Dubna) Grigory Trubnikov said that, in addition to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Germany are also participating in the project. According to the director, thanks to the Baikal telescope, Russia will become a world leader in the field of research into the properties of neutrinos. “Baikal will be the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, and the start of research on it is another triumph of Russian science and international scientific cooperation,” Trubnikov emphasized. He also noted that thanks to the installation it will be possible to detect much more high-energy particles than before, and it will also be possible to register particles that were born earlier than the Solar System.\nDocument [5]: Elusive carriers of the secrets of the Universe The panel discussion “Neutrinos - the elusive carriers of the secrets of the Universe” took place on June 5 at the stand of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum - 2021. Those gathered discussed current problems of neutrino physics, the role of neutrinos in cosmology, international neutrino experiments with the participation of Russian scientists and the formation of a new neutrino program, which should also involve biologists, doctors, mathematicians, mechanics and power engineers. Speaking about ways to “tame neutrinos,” the discussion participants noted the practical benefits that neutrino research can provide to other areas of knowledge. For example, the Baikal Neutrino Telescope will be useful to ecologists and geologists. In addition, the possibilities of monitoring nuclear reactors using neutrino detectors were considered. - The instruments with which Russian scientists work in the field of neutrino physics are the most modern and most ambitious, some of the best in the world. This is the Baikal neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD, and the unique Baksan Observatory in the North Caucasus. Thus, the Russian Federation has enormous weight and the highest reputation in the global scientific community,” emphasized the moderator of the discussion, RAS Academician, JINR Director Grigory Trubnikov, speaking about the role of international collaborations in megascience projects and in the development of neutrino physics. He also noted that in March 2021, at the ceremonial launch of the Baikal Neutrino Telescope in the presence of the Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation Valery Falkov, an agreement was reached on the development of a new neutrino program for fundamental and applied research in the field of neutrino physics, astrophysics and particle physics. - I think that by September 1, the prototype of such a large Russian neutrino program, as we now conventionally call it, will appear. Today’s session and the launch of the Baikal Neutrino Telescope is a great opportunity for us, physicists, not only to introduce ourselves to each other, but also to invite and persistently invite biologists, doctors, power engineers, mechanics, and mathematicians into this program,” said Grigory Trubnikov. The speakers were unanimous in the opinion that the program for the study of neutrino physics and astrophysics should be a good reason for the consolidation of all scientific institutes, the maximum pooling of resources, infrastructure, and intellectual potential to achieve breakthrough scientific results. INR RAS Director Maxim Libanov noted: “It is impossible to put barriers between institutes. It is necessary to combine their efforts and resources.” - The President of the Russian Federation, in his 2021 Address to the Federal Assembly, outlined three strategic scientific vectors for the state, at least for the next ten years. The first is the development of energy, the second is a medical “shield” for the state in the broadest sense of the word: from health protection to safety from various biological threats, and the third direction is climate ecology. Today, I hope, we not only convinced ourselves once again, but also made the audience feel: neutrino physics and\nDocument [6]: The third deep-sea neutrino telescope was deployed on Baikal Irkutsk, 05/16/18 (Teleinform news agency), - Scientists of the international collaboration “Baikal”, a key participant of which is the Research Institute of Applied Physics of Irkutsk State University, have completed the deployment of the third cluster of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The press service of the university reports this. Also, after routine maintenance was carried out to eliminate identified deficiencies on previously installed clusters, they were all combined into a single system for collecting and processing data. The Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope is designed to detect weak flashes of light (Cherenkov radiation) that arise as a result of the interaction of particles coming from space (neutrinos) with water. Neutrino streams are born in the most distant and powerful energy sources - these are, for example, supernova explosions or active galactic nuclei, and these particles, accordingly, are a unique carrier of information. Director of the Research Institute of Applied Physics, Professor Nikolai Budnev: – Neutrinos make it possible to obtain information about the internal structure of the most powerful sources of the Universe. In general, this is necessary to understand the history of the origin of the Universe, its development, its current state and what will happen to it in the future, and this gives us an understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, the fundamental laws of the structure of the Universe. Scientists believe that large deep-sea neutrino telescopes, once they reach a certain size, will usher in the era of neutrino astronomy, which involves studying the structure and processes of the Universe at incredibly vast distances. Work on the neutrino telescope project is being carried out by a large international collaboration, the main participants in which are the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna), Irkutsk State University, Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov. “The Baikal deep-sea neutrino telescope is a unique scientific installation in Russia and is included in the Global Neutrino Network as its most important element in the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth and as the first step towards creating the international scientific consortium “Global Neutrino Observatory,” notes the press release of the Baikal collaboration. .

A unique development will allow domestic scientists to register astrophysical neutrinos and the direction of their arrival with unprecedented accuracy. Neutrinos are uncharged neutral particles with low mass whose speed is close to the speed of light. Some researchers believe that they are capable of reaching the Earth without significant changes and delivering information about what happened in the Universe billions of years ago. Thus, their fixation can help solve many scientific problems and make many discoveries. The Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation Valery Falkov said that thanks to Baikal-GVD, “we will all understand together how the Universe works, we will read the history of the Universe, how galaxies were born,” writes TASS. The first data from the telescope is planned to be obtained in 2021. We remind you that gazeta.spb.ru previously reported that scientists have discovered similarities between humans and the ancient inhabitants of the ocean.\nDocument [8]: Telescope 91 will appear in the depths of Lake Baikal. The largest deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, Baikal-GVD, a unique “mega-scientific” installation necessary for exploring the Universe and creating new astronomy and astrophysics, will be launched today on Lake Baikal. This telescope will give scientists unprecedented opportunities to conduct geophysical, hydrological and limnological research, study the evolution of galaxies and the Universe, the press service of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation notes. The new telescope will give scientists opportunities that huge ground-based observatories and their “colleagues” located in space do not have, Radio Mayak reports.\nDocument [9]: A deep-sea neutrino telescope is being created on Lake Baikal. It will help understand the Universe. The installation of two clusters of the Baikal-GVD deep-sea neutrino telescope on Lake Baikal was completed by the international scientific group “Baikal”. According to Nikolai Budnev, head of the laboratory of astrophysics of elementary particles and gamma-ray astronomy at the Research Institute of Applied Physics at ISU, the first stage of the telescope consists of nine clusters. As part of the last expedition, the sixth and seventh clusters were installed. Budnev noted that completion of the first stage of the neutrino telescope is planned for 2021. Subsequently, the telescope can be enlarged several times. - Currently, all mounted clusters are combined into a single data collection and processing system. Specialists check and adjust the equipment of the entire telescope complex, reports the press service of Irkutsk State University. According to scientists, the neutrino telescope helps to obtain new fundamental knowledge about the Universe and understand the history of its origin and development, and predict its future.

Russian scientists - members of the multinational Dubna family - make a significant contribution to solving the most ambitious scientific problems at the forefront of world science at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. On this day, the Institute’s staff of many thousands congratulates all its colleagues from hundreds of research organizations and higher educational institutions of Russia on their professional holiday. It is deeply symbolic that on this special day the Year of Science and Technology starts in the Russian Federation. I am convinced that this decision of the President of the Russian Federation is not only a reflection of the special role played by the development of the scientific and technological sector for the country’s leadership, but also a symbol of the responsibility of people of science to society in finding answers to the great challenges facing the country and the world. JINR, being a leading international scientific center, contributes to the scientific and technological development of its country of residence, in particular by participating in the flagship initiatives of the Russian Federation in the field of science and technology. In November last year, with the participation of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation M.V. Mishustin, the first cascade of the NICA collider was launched at JINR - an initiative implemented within the framework of the National Project “Science” at the JINR site. Together with the Russian Ministry of Education and Science and the Russian Academy of Sciences, this year the unique, largest deep-sea neutrino telescope Baikal-GVD in the Northern Hemisphere will be put into operation. I am sure that this year JINR will present the Russian and international community with a number of large and small, but always striking scientific results and events.

Based on instruments on Voyager 2, NASA found that since November 5, the number of detected solar wind particles has dropped sharply, while the cosmic rays from the Milky Way have increased significantly. Space News reported that before this, its "brother" Voyager 1 (Voyager 1) had entered interstellar space through the helial circle in 2013. However, there are still differences between the two, so it is still worthy of study. . The heliosphere of the sun is the end of the solar wind, and beyond it is interstellar space. Voyager 1 leaves from the "upper" (north) of the solar system, while Voyager 2 leaves from the "lower" (south). /JPL) Ed Stone, former director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and now at the California Institute of Technology's Institute of Space Studies, said: "After 41 years of sailing, this is a major milestone." Stone pointed out that Voyager The location of No. 2 passing through the solar circle is not exactly the same as that of Voyager 1. No. 1 left from the northern hemisphere of the solar system, while No. 2 was in the southern hemisphere. Different departure locations will have different data. "If the data "One, then we would be quite surprised." Voyager 1 and 2 were planetary exploration ships launched in 1977. Their original mission destinations were Jupiter and Saturn. However, during the flight, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered that 2 As long as the orbit of the No. 1 was slightly adjusted, it could continue to investigate Uranus and Neptune. So after No. 1 completed its mission to Saturn and left toward the north of the solar system, No. 2 continued its journey to Uranus and Neptune. NASA's Voyager 2 Enters Interstellar Space Voyager. No. 2 arrived at Uranus in 1986 and observed this strange fallen gas planet at close range. The rings and satellites of Uranus are all rotating vertically. It may be that Uranus was knocked down by another huge gas planet billions of years ago. In addition, the Miranda satellite next to Uranus is also very strange. It is the smallest satellite of Uranus, but its surface is extremely rugged, like a pile of messy gravels.

The second man-made object to enter interstellar space after Voyager 1. "Voyager 2" and "Voyager 1" were launched in August and September 1977 respectively. Their original purpose was only to perform a five-year mission, but they have been in operation to this day. "Voyager 1" entered interstellar space in 2012, and "Voyager 2", which departed half a month earlier, entered interstellar space only last year. The two probes are currently traveling through the interstellar medium outside the solar system, that is, the vast cold region of the interstellar space outside the solar system. Five research reports published in the scientific journal "Nature Astronomy" on Monday (4th) provide important information for the exploration of "Voyager 2". The boundary of the solar system (that is, the zone where the solar wind blows furthest and interstellar space begins) is called the "heliopause". "Voyager 2" and "Voyager 1" also passed through the heliopause in less than a day, confirming that this area is very thin. When "Voyager 2" passed through the heliopause, its plasma wave instrument detected that the density of plasma (a group of charged particles) there increased sharply by 20 times, just like the interaction of two different liquids, and continued to detect Particles from the solar system spread outward. Caltech physicist Edward Stone said: "Fifty years ago, people thought that the solar wind would slowly fade away as it entered interstellar space from the solar system, but in fact there is a very clear dividing line there."

The particles of light "photons" (photons) propagate in a complete vacuum. The speed can reach 299,792 kilometers per second. But if we use this speed to travel between the earth and the moon or Mars, will we arrive in the blink of an eye? NASA has produced a set of interesting videos to visually illustrate how fast photons can fly. First, assume that the speed of light is used to orbit the Earth's equator, which has a circumference of 40075.02 kilometers. Since the speed of light will be refracted and slightly slowed down by the air, the photons passing along the surface of the earth without the atmosphere can circle the equator nearly 7.5 times per second. If you zoom out to the Earth and the Moon, the average distance between them is about 384,400 kilometers, and it takes about 2.51 seconds to go back and forth at the speed of light. At this time, the photons in the video feel like ping pong balls, bouncing back and forth between the Earth's surface and the Moon's surface. If it is from the Earth to Mars, the distance between the two is about 54.6 million kilometers. The distance between the two is about 54.6 million kilometers. The distance between the two is about 3 minutes and 2 seconds. In the film, it already feels like a turtle. climb. ▼▼NASA planetary scientist James O'Donoghue has produced a number of popular science animations to help viewers actually experience the limit of the speed of light. ▼▼ + 6 + 5 + 4 Odunosho also used real-time light speed to illustrate the distance from the sun to Pluto. The entire animation lasted nearly 5 and a half hours, which illustrates the vastness of the universe and makes the speed of light seem insignificant. By the way, the fastest man-made aircraft, the Parker Solar Probe, only reaches a speed of 343,112 kilometers per hour, which is not even close to the speed of light. It shows that human beings' ability to explore the unknown universe is extremely limited. "Business Insider" pointed out that operating a spacecraft cannot be as intuitive as operating a remote-controlled car. The instructions must be carefully thought out and packaged into packets, and sent to a specific location in space at a specific time to avoid missing the target. Therefore, planetary scientists face huge challenges when they want to contact spacecraft such as Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 that entered the interstellar space, as well as New Horizons that crossed Pluto, let alone contact neighboring star systems.

Voyager 1 has passed through the "helical circle" (the area of ​​space dominated or controlled by the sun) in 2012 and entered the interstellar medium. Scientists published research results in the journal "Nature Astronomy" on Monday local time and pointed out that Voyager 1 detected the frequency of plasma waves. After analyzing the data, a research team led by Cornell University found weak but persistent interstellar gas. sound. These findings make researchers believe that there are more low-level activities going on in the interstellar gas, prompting them to further explore the distribution of plasma in space, and help scientists deeply understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the solar wind.

This year's Shaw Prize in Astronomy was won by Edward C. Stone, the David Morris Chair Professor of Physics and Vice President for Special Projects at the California Institute of Technology. The Voyager project he led successfully explored Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. , Neptune, greatly improving mankind’s understanding of the stars in the universe and the outer solar system. Edward Stone pointed out that public awareness of scientific research helps scientific development, but with the development of society, rumors spread by social media are a challenge to scientific development. He said that people will always choose to believe what they want to believe. , it is recommended to "get the fact". Edward Stone has served as the Voyager project scientist since 1972. During the spacecraft's planetary flybys, he became the Voyager project spokesperson, responsible for explaining the Voyager project's scientific discoveries to the public. (Photo by Liang Pengwei) More than 40 years ago, who would have thought that we could see the eight planets in the vast space at close range, and thus learned that Jupiter's satellite "Io" has many volcanoes; that Saturn's rings have a complex structure; and that Uranus And Neptune turns out to have a magnetic field and even auroras. All of this is related to the spacecraft launched in the 1970s. In 1977, the Voyager spacecraft embarked on a space exploration journey. In 1977, the spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 set off from the earth and embarked on a space exploration journey. Between 1979 and 1981, two spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn; Voyager 2 visited Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989 respectively. Both projects were related to Edward C Stone, who He is the leader of the Traveler Project. Li Wenkai, associate professor of the Department of Physics, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Hong Kong, said that the Voyager Program allowed humans to clearly see the "real bodies" of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune for the first time, and also gave people a deeper understanding of the above four planets. learn. Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to enter interstellar space. The Shaw Astronomy Prize selection committee also praised the Voyager project for greatly improving mankind's understanding of the mass, size, shape and gravity fields of all giant planets and their many moons.

"Voyager 2" and "Voyager 1" also passed through the heliopause in less than a day, confirming that this area is very thin. To the researchers' surprise, Voyager 1 detected interstellar plasma particles in outer space after crossing the heliopause, but Voyager 2 did the opposite. The plasma wave instrument built by the University of Iowa for Voyager 2 detected a 20-fold increase in the density of plasma (a group of charged particles) as it passed through the heliopause, just like two Different liquids interact while continuing to detect particles from the solar system spreading outward. Voyager 1's plasma detector was damaged and difficult to detect. Edward Stone, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, said: "Fifty years ago, people thought that the solar wind would slowly fade away as it entered interstellar space from the solar system, but in fact there was a very clear dividing line there. To us "It's a very exciting time... We're going to see a transition from an internal magnetic field to a different external magnetic field, and we're making unexpected and surprising discoveries all the time." Technically, we're still not leaving the solar system. The Voyager probes have not yet left the solar system. Based on their current daily flight of about 1.6 million kilometers, it will take another 300 years for Voyager 1 to reach the outermost "Oort Cloud" region of the solar system. It will take another 30,000 years to leave. Their built-in lithium-ion batteries are expected to operate for another five years.

The Voyager Project "Golden Record" flies beyond the outer reaches of the solar system. ▲Voyager 1 and the "Golden Record". The back of the golden record has instructions for use and marks the Earth's position in the universe. (Picture/Taken from NASA website) International Center/Comprehensive Report Since humans began exploring space in the 1950s, aerospace technology has continued to advance in the decades, but the launch operation lasted the longest and was the furthest from the earth in human history. The aircraft was actually the Voyager project launched in 1977. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 each carry a piece of "Earth's Golden Record" and have been flying in space for 41 years, even beyond the solar system. NASA's "Voyager program" is a planetary exploration program started in the late 1970s. A total of two spacecraft were built, namely Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. Although scientists originally only targeted Jupiter and Saturn for detection, in the end both detectors successfully reached the edge of the solar system and continued to move toward the outer reaches of the system. Among them, Voyager 1 is currently the farthest man-made object from the earth, and Voyager 2 continued to Uranus and Neptune after visiting Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977. It is the longest-running space probe in human history and is still in operation today. Voyager 2 is almost identical to its sister ship Voyager 1. The difference is that Voyager 2 follows a slower flight path, so it remains in the ecliptic plane (the plane of the solar system's planets) and flies past Saturn. Flying to Uranus and Neptune due to "gravitational acceleration". The reason why the Voyager program was launched in 1977 was because Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune happened to be on the same side of the sun at that time, which was an excellent observation opportunity once in 176 years. Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977. Although it took off two weeks later than its sister ship, after several gravitational accelerations, it made it faster than any existing aircraft. Voyager 1 began observing Jupiter in January 1979, and passed by Saturn and Saturn's moon Titan in 1980. Due to the influence of gravity, the aircraft finally left the ecliptic plane and moved away from the solar system at a speed of 17 kilometers per second. In 1990, Voyager 1 took the famous "Solar System Family Portrait" from outer space, in which the Earth looked like a pale blue dot (Pale Blue Dot) in the endless space, suspended in the dark solar system. The famous American astronomer Carl Sagan was inspired by the photos and wrote a book of the same name. Sagan wrote a classic revelation in the book, "Look at this little dot again. Right here. This is home. This is us. In this little dot... everything about us exists. Such a particle is suspended on a bunch of dust in a beam of sunlight. ▼The Earth photographed by Voyager 1 is just a dim blue dot in the vast\nDocument [8]: NASA reconnects with Voyager 2 and it is still sailing - After eight long months of international silence, NASA finally made contact with the Voyager 2 probe again. The Voyager 2 is still sailing. Explore the far reaches of the solar system. Science Alert reported that Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, and surveyed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and then continued to survey the outer reaches of the solar system. It was the most fruitful among NASA's space programs. one of the spacecraft. This navigator, which continues to rewrite astronomical books, has been traveling in space for 43 years. Most of the time, it has good communication with our earth. However, it has lost contact recently. This is not due to some malfunction of Voyager 2 or aliens. Capture or some weird phenomenon is a problem here on Earth. It turned out that the only antenna that could communicate with Voyager 2, which was the Deep Space Station 43 (DSS-43) antenna in Eastern Australia, needed equipment maintenance. As a last resort, I had to say to Voyager 2, "Let's contact you later." ”. The only DSS43 antenna on Earth capable of communicating with Voyager 2. (Photo/NASA) In March this year, NASA announced that the DSS-43 antenna requires major upgrades, which will take about 11 months and will not be completed until February 2021. Fortunately, now, eight months later, enough of the upgrade has been installed to allow preliminary testing to begin. Last week, NASA sent the first communication after equipment maintenance to Voyager 2, which is 18.7 billion kilometers away. It was a series of self-check commands. After several hours of waiting, Voyager 2 returned a confirmation that it had been received. The command is signaled and executed. Obviously this old spacecraft is still responding to us faithfully. DSS-43 is a rotating parabolic mirror radio antenna with a diameter of 70 meters. It was built in 1973. It was 64 meters at the time and expanded to the current 70 meters in 1987. It was the largest steerable antenna in the world at that time. Since its responsibility is to communicate with Voyager 2, it has not been offline for more than 30 years since the major upgrade in 1987. Many equipment are so old that they must be replaced. As part of the refurbishment, DSS-43 will receive two new antennas, as well as upgrades to the antenna heating (for snow removal) and cooling equipment, power supply equipment and other electronic equipment to supply the new transmitter. As for why DSS-43 is the only dish in the world that can communicate with Voyager 2, it is because after Voyager 2 flew by Neptune’s satellite Triton in 1989, Voyager 2’s trajectory was relative to the direction of the solar system. The plane of the planet is significantly southerly, which means that dish antennas in the northern hemisphere cannot communicate with it. Suzanne Dodd, the director of the Voyager interplanetary mission, was asked by the media whether everything is okay on Voyager 2? Or is it like many science fiction movies,\nDocument [9]: The U.S. military's X-37B returned from a mysterious mission and broke a record after 718 days of flight. The X-37B returned to the Kennedy Space Base in the United States after 718 days of flight. Military personnel wearing protective clothing inspected the X-37B. (Photo/U.S. Air Force Twitter) After 718 days in Earth orbit, the U.S. Air Force’s secret unmanned space shuttle X-37B finally flew back to Earth on Sunday morning and landed on the runway at the Kennedy Space Base in Florida. However, the space missions it performs are still confidential, and it is difficult for the outside world to know what kind of missions this space shuttle has been performing in the past nearly two years. Space.com reported that the X-37B also caused a brief loud noise in Florida. During the process of returning to the earth, the space shuttle violently rubbed against the air, causing a supersonic sonic boom. Many people in southeastern Florida Can be heard everywhere. What's more special is that the X-37B's previous three missions have landed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which is owned by the U.S. Air Force, but this time it landed at the Kennedy Space Base for the first time. The U.S. Air Force stated that it made this change to make orbital navigation more flexible. The purpose and mission of the X-37B are military secrets. (Photo/U.S. Air Force Twitter) Currently, the U.S. Air Force has two X-37B unmanned space shuttles built by Boeing. This 29-foot (8.8-meter-long) X-37B is considered to be a mini version of NASA's previous large space shuttle. It is the replacement that the U.S. Air Force needs after the space shuttle is retired in 2011. As for it The function of the X-37B is a secret. The outside world has been speculating that the X-37B should be some kind of weapon that may be able to capture or destroy enemy satellites. Therefore, the X-37B should be called a "space fighter" in appearance. However, U.S. Air Force officials have always strongly opposed this view, emphasizing that the unmanned space shuttle is only testing important space technology in orbit and is of a scientific research nature, not destruction. Sexual. U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Captain AnnMarie Annicelli told the media that there are many areas that can be researched in space, including advanced command systems, navigation equipment and control devices; thermal insulation protection systems, Avionics equipment, reusable high-temperature-resistant structures and air-tight materials, etc. Of course, it also includes navigation related to autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing. Most aerospace experts agree with the Air Force’s reply and believe that enemy satellites can be captured directly. The hostility is too strong and may lead to war. However, it is still possible for the X-37B to intercept the opponent's information as a spy satellite during its voyage. Each flight of the X-37B is longer than the previous one. Its first mission (OTV-1) took off on April 22, 2010 and spent 224 days in space; OTV-2 started on March 5, 2011 and sailed for 468 days; OTV-3 on December 2012 It started on\nDocument [10]: Voyager 1 is still sending back data after 43 years of flight. Plasma frequencies were detected at the edge of the solar system. ▲Voyager 1. (Picture/reproduced from Wikipedia) Intern reporter Wu Yanzhen/Taipei report NASA's Voyager 1 was launched in 1977. It is the farthest aircraft from the earth and has the first speed, making it two weeks earlier. The launched sister ship "Voyager 2" will never surpass it. It was originally expected to maintain operation for 5 years. Unexpectedly, it has been flying for 43 years and is still sending back data to this day. Recently, when traveling through the edge of the solar system, the frequency of continuous plasma waves was unexpectedly detected, prompting scientists to further explore the distribution of plasma in space. Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross the solar circle and enter the interstellar medium in 2012. The research results published by the Cornell University research team in the journal "Nature Astronomy" on the 11th pointed out that when analyzing the detector's plasma wave system (Plasma Wave System, PWS) data, Voyager 1 detected the frequency of plasma waves, and found weak but persistent sounds of interstellar gas. Researchers believe that there are more low-level activities taking place in the interstellar gas. This new discovery helps them understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the solar wind, prompting the team to further explore the distribution of plasma in space. Cornell researcher Shami Chatterjee said, "We didn't have the opportunity to evaluate it in the past, and now we know that we don't need to rely on chance events related to the sun to measure interstellar plasma." "No matter what the sun is doing, navigators will measure it." The data was sent back."

This project is considered the most outstanding in the history of astronautics. The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 (English - traveler) devices launched back in 1977 and have been in flight for 42 years. There have been many times over the years that the mission seemed about to end due to technical problems, but NASA experts found ways to continue it. And now they have developed a whole program that should extend the life of the project. Of course, the survivability of these devices is amazing. After all, they are equipped with very old technology by our standards: transmitters based on traveling wave lamps, data exchange occurs at the speed of an ordinary telephone modem - and this is at cosmic distances, where the answer comes in a few hours. And on this “antique” the devices not only fly, but obtain unique information about space. Scientists are unanimous: the effect of the mission is colossal; it has radically changed many ideas about the Solar System and its planets. Voyagers for the first time transmitted unique data about Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus - and their satellites. And then they went beyond the solar system altogether: Voyager 1 in 2012, and Voyager 2 in 2018. Now they travel in interstellar space, continuing to transmit invaluable information to Earth. By the way, the first traveler is located at a distance of almost 21.6 billion kilometers from Earth, the second - 18.3 billion. What are these amazing devices? These are autonomous robots equipped with scientific instruments for various research, as well as power plants, rocket engines, three computers, radio communication and control systems. The total weight of each device is about 721 kg. Unlike spacecraft exploring the planets of the solar system, Voyagers could not use solar panels. After all, the further from the Sun, the weaker the flux of solar radiation. For example, near Neptune it is about 900 times smaller than in Earth's orbit. Therefore, the source of electricity is three generators, the fuel in which is plutonium-238. INFOGRAPHIC "RG" / ANTON PEREPLETCHIKOV / YURI MEDVEDEV Now generators produce 40 percent less energy than at start, and therefore savings become the number one issue for the devices. In addition, engines wear out and their reliability decreases. And NASA scientists are racking their brains on how to get out of the situation, how to extend the lifespan of travelers. First of all, it is proposed to find the optimal mode for all systems, periodically turn off some of them so that others can work at this time. In addition, all cameras that photograph stars will be turned off. Obviously, we will have to abandon the heaters that maintain the set temperature in the devices. But perhaps the main problem is the engines. In 2017, Voyager 1 was already forced to start up backup engines, which had been “idle” for 37 years, and now, obviously, Voyager 2’s backup engines, which have not\nDocument [2]: Voyager 2 experienced a technical failure - NASA Voyager (photo - NASA) The NASA Voyager 2 space probe, which is currently roaming interstellar space, is experiencing technical difficulties. The agency's press service reports this. On January 25, Voyager failed to complete a maneuver during which it was supposed to turn 360 degrees to calibrate its onboard magnetic field instruments. Then an error occurred - and two energy-consuming systems began to work simultaneously. See also: NASA researcher: We must fly to Saturn's moon to look for life This triggered the launch of an automatic failure protection program that turned off scientific instruments to make up for the energy deficit. As of January 28, Voyager engineers had successfully shut down one of the powerful systems and turned the science instruments back on, but had not yet resumed data collection. Complicating the situation is that the probe is located 18.5 billion kilometers from Earth. Signals traveling at the speed of light reach it in 17 hours, and the answer from Voyager arrives in the same amount of time. Mission engineers must wait about 34 hours to find out whether their actions helped fix the problem or not. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched in 1977 to study the giant planets and the periphery of the solar system. They are now in interstellar space. These are the most distant objects in space that man has created. They are now in interstellar space. These are the most distant objects in space that man has created.

One might consider this not such an important event for humanity, but thanks to it, scientists will receive new unique data, because on board the second “traveler” there is equipment that has long been out of order on Voyager 1. Recall that the heliosphere is the region from which the solar wind displaces interstellar gas. Many specialists, especially those working in the field of solar physics, consider its boundaries to be the boundaries of the solar system, Vesti reports. Recall that Voyager 2 was launched in 1977. It is currently more than 18 billion kilometers from Earth, far beyond the orbit of Pluto. A radio signal from our planet takes 16.5 hours to reach the device. For comparison: a radio wave travels the distance between the Earth and the Sun in eight minutes. In October 2018, it became clear that the probe was approaching the boundaries of the heliosphere. This was indicated by data from the cosmic ray detector. However, it remained unclear when he would cross the cherished line. And then NASA representatives announced that Voyager 2 went beyond the boundaries of the heliosphere on November 5. Scientists needed the month that had passed since then to accumulate data and verify the correctness of their conclusions. The main argument for experts was the readings of the PLS device. It measures the density, speed and temperature of the plasma flow in which the device moves. According to this instrument, behind Voyager 2 the solar wind was irrevocably replaced by interstellar gas. By the way, PLS readings will be the main contribution of Voyager 2 to the study of the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 left the heliosphere in 2012, but a similar instrument on board failed back in 1980. By the way, the name "Voyager" can be translated not only as a traveler, but also as a navigator. It can be assumed that the scientists who named the devices that way many years ago meant that they would someday be able to open up completely new horizons for humanity. However, no one was sure of this. And now, after more than forty years, data from the cosmic ray recorder, low-energy particle counter and magnetometer also confirm that the second “traveler” also entered interstellar space. Both Voyagers obtain energy from the decay of radioactive elements in a generator. Generating power is reduced by four watts per year, so engineers have to phase out the least relevant devices at this stage of the journey (for example, cameras) in order to save energy for the most important tools. Note that not all experts are ready to consider the Voyagers to have left the solar system. Although there is no doubt that they went beyond the boundaries of the heliosphere.\nDocument [4]: The Voyager 1 probe heard the rumble of interstellar space. The device is located outside the solar system. The Voyager 1 probe, which was launched into space by NASA 40 years ago, was able to “hear” the sound of interstellar space. This was reported by the TV channel "360" with reference to kod.ru. According to the publication, in 2012 the probe went beyond the solar system, but continues to send signals to Earth. So Voyager was able to record plasma waves, which are expressed in a constant hum of interstellar gas. The author of the study, Stella Ocker, explained that the hum is very weak, as it is in a narrow frequency band. She also emphasized that his presence is constant and monotonous. The specialist also said that with the help of the probe, scientists were able to hear what coronary ejections from the Sun sound like. According to them, the noise is similar to thunder. Let us remember that Voyager 1 was launched into space 44 years ago. Despite its service life of 38 years, the probe continues to perform its work outside the solar system. The device runs on plutonium-238. Earlier, a Roscosmos launch vehicle launched 36 British communications satellites into orbit.

The Voyager 2 space probe of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) entered interstellar space last year, repeating the achievement of the Voyager 1 spacecraft. JPL/NASA. The scientific journal Nature Astronomy this week published a series of articles analyzing messages from the Voyager 2 probe since its entry into interstellar space at a distance of 18 billion kilometers from Earth in November 2018. They describe Voyager 2's journey, including its passage through the heliopause (the part of the solar system exposed to particles and ions from deep space) and the heliosphere (the region of the heliosphere outside the shock wave) to what lies beyond the universe. The spacecraft will be able to continue sending data about its journey back to Earth. Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to take measurements of interstellar space as they fly, but are expected to only have enough energy to operate them for the next five years or so. NASA is not currently planning any further missions into interstellar space.\nDocument [6]: Scientists have described the processes of Voyager 2 entering interstellar space Scientists have described the processes of Voyager 2 entering interstellar space Five scientific articles on the boundary of the heliosphere and interstellar space were published a year after the Voyager 2 spacecraft left limits of space filled with solar wind. He flew towards this goal for more than 40 years. Each document describes in detail the results of one of the five operating scientific instruments of the device, NASA reports. Voyager 2 is equipped with two instruments for detecting energetic particles in different energy ranges, two plasma instruments and a magnetic field sensor. Scientists believe that there is a transition zone between the heliosphere and interstellar space, since Voyager 2, like Voyager 1, recorded sharp changes: the speed of heliosphere particles fell sharply, and the speed of cosmic rays, on the contrary, increased. “Voyager's research shows us how the Sun interacts with the matter that fills much of the space between stars,” Ed Stone, a Caltech physics professor and Voyager project leader, told NASA. Scientists also noticed that the magnetic field in the region immediately beyond the heliopause is parallel to the magnetic field inside the heliosphere. Let us recall that Voyager 2 entered interstellar space in November 2018. He has been flying to the boundary of the heliosphere since 1977.\nDocument [7]: Voyager 2 entered interstellar space Launched in 1977, the Voyager 2 space probe crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space, thus becoming the second spacecraft created by mankind to reach this region. As reported on the NASA website, according to instrument data, the device crossed the outer edge of the heliosphere on November 5. It was from this date, as explained by the head of the Voyager scientific research program, Ed Stone, that the Plasma Science Experiment (PLS) on-board device stopped recording the flow of solar wind in the Voyager 2 environment. These data allowed astrophysicists to be confident that the probe left the heliosphere. “Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012, but Voyager 2 has instruments operational that will provide first-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this unique gateway to interstellar space,” the scientists noted. The probe is currently located about 18 billion kilometers from Earth. Mission operators can communicate with the probe, but receiving the information, which travels at the speed of light, takes about 16.5 hours. By comparison, light from the Sun takes about eight minutes to reach Earth. According to Stone, the information transmitted by Voyager 2 will allow astrophysicists to advance their study of the region of interstellar space. Scientists also explained that crossing the heliosphere does not mean that Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have left the solar system, and this is unlikely to happen in the near future. According to astronomers, the boundary of the solar system is located beyond the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a cluster of small objects under the influence of the Sun's gravity. “Voyager 2 will take about 300 years to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud, and perhaps 30,000 years to fly beyond it,” Stone added. The Voyager 2 space probe was launched in August 1977, 16 days earlier than Voyager 1. The missions were originally designed to last five years to thoroughly study Jupiter and Saturn, but were subsequently expanded as this proved feasible. The flights of both stations, which have been going on for 41 years, have become the longest space missions. According to calculations, the ships will be able to maintain contact with the control center on Earth until 2027. On board each probe are golden records with recordings of earthly sounds, music and messages from humanity to possible alien civilizations.\nDocument [8]: NASA spoke about plans to extend the mission of the Voyager spacecraft. The Voyager space missions are among the longest in the history of astronautics. They started in 1977, their task was to study the giant planets. The devices received high-quality images of Jupiter and Saturn for the first time, and Voyager 2 reached Uranus and Neptune for the first time. After this, the agency extended the mission of the probes and began to monitor them as they flew to the borders of the solar system. In 2013, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to leave the heliosphere. It is now 145 AU from Earth, while Voyager 2 is 120 AU. The probes' mission was supposed to last only five years, but it will soon be almost 42 years old. The Voyagers are equipped with radioisotope generators containing plutonium-238, which has a relatively short half-life (87 years). Generators generate energy for scientific instruments and maintain the required temperature for their operation. Now generators produce 40% less heat, and engineers are looking for ways to extend the mission of the devices. To do this, they - after lengthy discussions - drew up an energy saving plan. This includes turning off the cosmic ray sensor heater on Voyager 2. The researchers believed that the sensor had already played its main role - in November 2018, when scientists were able to track that the probe had left the heliosphere. The data that Voyagers provided helped scientists understand the nature of energy and radiation in space, which could later help in preparing manned missions and human space travel. However, team members note that the Voyager 2 instrument works without a heater. It was turned off a month ago, but the sensor is still sending data - even at temperatures of about -60 °C (the device was tested more than 42 years ago at temperatures of -45 °C). At the same time, the researchers emphasize that the device on the other Voyager also works - although it has been operating for several years at temperatures lower than in tests. It is incredible that Voyager's instruments operate under such conditions. We are proud that they have stood the test of time. The long life of the spacecraft means that we have prepared for situations that we have never encountered before. We will continue to explore all ways to enable Voyagers to produce the best science. Suzanne Dodd, project manager for the Voyager mission Voyager 2 carries four more instruments - two plasma sensors, a magnetometer and a low-energy particle detector. In the coming years, NASA plans to consistently turn off the instruments on Voyagers in order to extend the life of the devices. Another problem is that the main engines of Voyager 2 are gradually becoming unusable. Scientists want to make sure that the probe's antenna will be facing the Earth, and therefore they will turn on backup engines to adjust the course and the apparatus - for the first time since 1989, when the probe flew past Neptune. Earlier in 2017, this adjustment was successfully completed for\nDocument [9]: It has become known what NASA will do with the unfortunate Voyagers. Following Voyager 1, NASA will turn off the main engines of Voyager 2. The twin spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are running out of energy, and the scientific community is already has been trying for a long time to figure out how to prolong their life. Voyager mysteriously disappeared into space Let us recall that the twin spacecraft were launched into space 42 years ago. To date, they are the only probes located beyond the boundaries of the heliosphere and transmitting scientific data from there to planet Earth. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are located more than 120 times farther from the Sun than the Earth itself. Every day the twin spacecraft operate is a day of new discoveries, as both probes explore regions that have never been visited before. Just recently, NASA experts came up with a plan to ensure Voyager 2's uninterrupted operation for several more years. Let us recall that both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have three power sources based on the decay of plutonium-238. The reserves of this element are decreasing every year, and the generators of their decay themselves are degrading. According to official estimates, the Voyagers' power supply drops by about four watts each year. Engineers, we note, have already begun to disable the least important devices of the twin devices - for example, cameras have not been functioning for a long time. Voyager 2 currently only has five instruments working. Its brother has even less - only four. Voyager 2, however, no longer has enough energy to power five instruments. Scientists had to turn off the CRS heater. The irony is that it was he who helped the whole world learn about Voyager 2's entry into interstellar space. So far, the device, even though its temperature has dropped to -59 degrees Celsius, is still functioning. But, the scientific community notes, this temperature is already ten degrees lower than the one at which the system was tested on planet Earth. In 2017, NASA experts turned off the main engines of Voyager 1. Now they have decided to do the same with Voyager 2. Engineers from the United States of America hope that these solutions will extend the operation of the device for several more years. Earlier, Pravda.Ru wrote that Roscosmos increased the cost of flights on Soyuz spacecraft for cosmonauts from the United States.

Interestingly, the device is still exploring the universe and has just sent another piece of new information. In particular, he caught the sound of the space surrounding him, Day.Az reports with reference to hi-tech.news. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue their journey through interstellar space unhindered. For several years, both probes have been outside the solar system, but still send back various, almost invaluable information. Unfortunately, Voyager 1 will stop such transmissions in 2025 because it will run out of the electrical power needed to carry them out. Recently, the probe recorded a characteristic "hum" emanating from the environment. Stella Koch Ocker, an astrophysicist at Cornell University who is part of the data analysis team for the US space probe, says the sound is very weak and monotonous because it is present in a narrow frequency band. More precisely, we are talking about the sounds of the substance that fills the Universe between the stars, that is, gas, plasma (gases heated to very high temperatures) or cosmic dust. With this discovery, scientists will be able to better understand how the interstellar medium (that is, all the matter between stars) interacts with the solar wind and how interstellar space affects the heliosphere (the solar disk that protects the solar system). How long will the probes travel around the universe? According to scientists, their flight could even take thousands of years, and we can only hope that one day they will fulfill one of the goals of their mission and collide with another civilization. After all, on board both probes there are special Golden Records discs, on which information about humanity was provided for alien civilizations.\n\nReport:

Malala, the 23-year-old winner of the Nobel Prize, has given a detailed interview to the British Vogue magazine, and her picture has been published on the cover of the July issue of this magazine. Malala Yousafzai graduated from Oxford University last year. "I was excited about everything, from going to McDonald's to playing poker with my friends," he says. "I enjoy every moment of my life because I haven't experienced many things before. I haven't had many opportunities to be around people my age." Malala was attacked by Taliban forces when she was 14 years old. In her country, Pakistan, she had launched a campaign for girls' right to education.

She says, "She has never had the opportunity to be with people her own age because she has spent all these years recovering from the attack, going to different countries, He has written books, produced documentaries and many other adventures have happened to him. "And in college I finally found some time for myself". "For me, wearing a headscarf is not a sign of restriction," Malala, whose image was featured on the British Vogue magazine with a red scarf, says that her covering does not mean "restriction". She says that this veil is a sign of her roots as a Sunni Muslim woman from the Pashtun tribe. He goes on to say: "We Muslim girls or Pashtun girls or Pakistani girls, if we wear our traditional clothes, everyone thinks we are in bondage or oppressed or oppressed by patriarchy." "I want to tell everyone that by preserving the culture, you can seek the right and you can achieve equality in your culture." He criticizes some activism in social networks and says that such things "need to change". Malala told Vogue magazine: "Right now, activism is defined by tweets, and that has to change because Twitter is a whole other world." "Greta asks me for advice" Malala Yousafzai mentioned her close relationship with other young activists and said that she is in contact with Greta Thunberg and Greta texts her for advice.

Ms. Yousafzai is now 20 years old and is a human rights activist. In 2012, she was attacked by Taliban gunmen due to her opposition to the ban on girls' education and was severely wounded in the head. After this attack, he seriously pursued the issue of promoting women's right to education, which was met with universal praise. Malala is expected to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi during this trip. A well-informed source told AFP that details of Malala Yousafzai's visit to Pakistan have been kept secret due to the "sensitivity" of the matter. Pakistani television showed images of him and his family at Islamabad's Binazir Bhutto International Airport, which indicated tight security measures. Local media have said that officials from the Malala Foundation will accompany Mrs. Yousafzai on this 4-day trip. It is not yet known whether he will visit his relatives in the Swat Valley, a region in northwestern Pakistan. His trip to Pakistan after six years has been met with reactions from users on Twitter and many have asked for a warm welcome to this activist.

Why was she attacked? At the age of 11, Malala Yousafzai was writing notes for the BBC's Urdu section about life under Taliban rule in an anonymous blog. On this blog, he talked about the right to education of girls in this era. At the age of 15, he was attacked by Taliban forces while riding a school bus. This action of the Taliban caused the story of Malala to attract the attention of the world. The Pakistani Taliban said at the time that it targeted him because he was "supporting the West and promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas." Malala was seriously injured in the head during this attack. After he was given emergency treatment at a military hospital in Pakistan, he was transferred to a hospital in Birmingham, England for further treatment. where he has been living with his family ever since. Due to this attack, Malala was partially paralyzed in her face and lost part of her hearing. What activities has Malala been doing since then? After recovering, Malala Yousafzai has continued her activities regarding children's education. Together with her father, she founded the Malala Foundation, which aims to work for a world where every girl has the right to education without fear. In 2014, he was the youngest person to jointly win the Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi.

Few people can be indifferent to the developments in today's world and what is happening in the corners of the world. Of course, when it comes to serious issues, usually children and teenagers stay away from the group of social activists and it is often said that they live in their own world. The new generation of teenagers is often called a selfish generation who do not think about anything other than paying attention to their personal interests and are far away from what is happening in different areas of human life and do not pay attention to it. But history has engraved the names of teenagers who have caused the transformation of views on various issues. Children and teenagers, far beyond their age, have presented issues that were acute in their opinion in any period of time. These history-making teenagers, with their persistent efforts and activities, were able to draw the attention of politicians and leaders of countries to issues whose solution has brought about the spiritual and spiritual salvation of a large number of the world's inhabitants, and also promoted charity and increased awareness, as well as a basis for improving conditions. People's lives, especially teenage girls. These days, there is a lot of talk about Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who is a young environmental activist, who arrived in New York after traveling 4,800 kilometers across the Atlantic Ocean to participate in the United Nations Climate Summit. Upon arriving in New York, when reporters asked him if he thought he could make US President Donald Trump listen to his point of view, he said: No, I don't have a special position. I can't convince everyone. "But my message to Mr. Trump is to look at the scientific evidence, which he clearly doesn't." Greta Thunberg has inspired a global climate change movement by organizing a student protest. The first strike for his region was held in front of the Swedish Parliament in August last year.

We need to find out what the previous generation brought upon us, which we now have to correct and deal with. We must make our voice heard. But besides Greta, there were other teenagers who even won the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan is one of them. When Malala Yousafzai was 11 years old, she anonymously wrote and published her memories of her life in Pakistan under the Taliban regime in her blog, which soon attracted a lot of attention. Soon after, she spoke publicly about the need for girls to get proper education in various places.

A Pakistani girl who survived a brutal assassination and became a sensation. Perhaps, among the children who were able to influence their fate and their peers, the names of Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg have been heard more than others, while there are no few history-making and trend-setting girls in the world. Although many believe that the presence of children in international communities is just a ridiculous children's show and children are abused in these cases, but still many of them are trying to get their rights all over the world; One shouts and protests to save the environment and the other just wants to go to school and study. "We are victims of exploitation and abuse. We are street children. We are children of war. We are AIDS victims and orphans. We are deprived of education and health care. We are victims of political, economic, cultural, religious and environmental discrimination. We are children whose voices are not heard. It's time to count us out. We want a world worthy of children because a world worthy of us is a world worthy of everyone. You call us the future, but we still exist now. We are not the root of problems, we are the necessary tools to solve problems. We are not a cost, we are capital. We are not just young people, we are people and citizens of this world." This is part of a report entitled "Build a world worthy of us" that young people from 154 countries raised about ways to change the situation of children in 2002 and at the United Nations, and "Gabriela Ariye Ta" 13 years old from Bolivia, was the first person to speak in front of World leaders spoke at the United Nations Children's Summit in 2002.

Nadia Murad is a 25-year-old young Yazidi woman who managed to escape from the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) and works to end human trafficking and sexual violence. Denis Mukwigi is a doctor from the Democratic Republic of Congo who helps women who are victims of sexual violence. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Denise Mukwigi helps women victims of sexual violence The pair were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon in wars and conflicts. The head of the Nobel committee said that the two played a "vital role" in the fight against such crimes. Denis Mukwegi and his colleagues in Congo have treated nearly three hundred thousand rape victims and have extensive experience in the field of treating injuries caused by sexual violence. In 2014, Nadia Murad was captured by ISIS as a sex slave along with thousands of Yazidi Kurdish girls and women. Six of his brothers were killed. During their presence in Iraq, fighters of the Islamic State group enslaved hundreds of Yazidi women and girls. After escaping from ISIS, Mrs. Murad interviewed Nafisa Kohnoord, a BBC Persian reporter, and told her story. Nadia Murad said that she was gang-raped during captivity and was bought and sold several times before she managed to escape. In 2016, he was chosen by the United Nations as a Goodwill Ambassador for "Protecting the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking". After Malala Yousafzai, Nadia Murad is the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala Yousafzai was seventeen years old when she received this award in 2014.\nDocument [7]: Malala Yousafzai visited her hometown Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, visited her hometown, Mingora, located in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, on Saturday, the 11th of April, after about six years. Malala Yousafzai, who is now 20 years old, was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 in this area, which is located in the northwest of Pakistan. At that time, he encouraged the education of Pakistani women and girls in his blog. Malala Yousafzai told AFP: "I left Swat with my eyes closed and now I'm back with my eyes open." Malala left Swat after being shot while in a coma. He was first admitted to the army hospital and then transferred to Birmingham, United Kingdom by plane. The youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner added: "I am very happy. My dream came true. Due to the precious bravery of my brothers and sisters, peace has returned to Swat." Malala Yousafzai's return to her hometown took place under strict security measures. Malala's parents and two brothers accompanied her on this trip. The security measures have been adopted after a number of conservatives and religious extremists in Pakistan have called Malala "an agent of the West and a source of shame for Pakistan". After meeting friends and relatives, Malala went to Swat Military College and spent a few minutes with the students of this center. However, Malala's pre-announced speech was not held in this college and she immediately returned to Islamabad. Malala Yousafzai received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 at the age of seventeen. He is currently studying at Oxford University. The Swat valley, which is the birthplace of Malala, came under the control of the Pakistani Taliban in 2007, but their control over this area ended with the attack of the army. However, complete security has not yet been established in this area. In February this year, 11 soldiers were killed in this area.

Malala Yousafzai arrived at Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Thursday morning (March 29/9 Farvardin) in an unannounced trip with her parents. They then went to the hotel under strict security measures and accompanied by a convoy of 15 vehicles. Local officials are worried that Taliban Islamists will take advantage of the opportunity of Yousafzai's presence in Pakistan to do what they failed to do in 2012. On October 9, 2012, masked men stopped a school service in the Swat region of northwestern Pakistan, asked "who is Malala," and shot her in the head. Two of his classmates were also injured. Malala Yousafzai was transferred to a hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and then to Birmingham, UK for treatment, and was miraculously saved from death. Today, Thursday, he traveled to his country for the first time after the aforementioned attack. Join Deutsche Welle Farsi channel on Telegram. According to local media, he will stay in Pakistan for a total of 4 days. One of her relatives told the German news agency that Malala Yousafzai will meet with Pakistani officials in the first two days and the next two days are dedicated to meeting friends and relatives. Yousefzai's place of residence has been kept secret for security reasons, and for these reasons, he will not travel to his place of residence. Malala Yousafzai met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his office an hour after arriving in Pakistan. According to the announcement of Pakistan's Ministry of Information, a group of women's rights activists from all over Pakistan, led by Ms. Shermin Obaid Chenai, an Oscar-winning journalist and filmmaker, will visit her today. In many public speeches, Yousafzai mentioned his country with pride and said in his mother tongue - Pashto - that he would return to his country. "National Hero" on Thursday morning and with the news of Malala Yousafzai's presence in Pakistan, a wave of joy started among her fans. A hashtag in his name on Twitter became a trend in Pakistani cyberspace in a short period of time. The news of his presence was also at the top of the media news. Yousafzai is considered a national and honorable model among the generally educated and intellectual classes of Pakistan. The election of Malala Yousafzai as the UN Peace Ambassador (April 10, 2017 in New York alongside Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General) Imran Khan Niazi, a Pakistani politician and former cricket player, considered Yousafzai's return as a sign of the defeat of extremists in his country. Mrs. Marvi Maiman, one of the senior leaders of the ruling Muslim League party, while welcoming Yousafzai's presence in Pakistan, considered this event a source of her satisfaction and a proud day for Pakistan. Hamid Mir, one of the few journalists who interviewed Malala Yousafzai before her assassination, called her a "Pakistani girl" whose future belongs to Pakistan, returning to this country and pledging to serve Pakistan. He said that Malala Yousafzai planned to visit Pakistan two years ago and this short trip\nDocument [9]: Malala went to her hometown for the first time after the Taliban attack Photo copyright AFP Image caption Mrs. Yousafzai traveled by helicopter to the Swat Valley Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the first time in 5 years after being the target of the Taliban attack Garib traveled to his hometown Mingora in Pakistan. This Saturday, April 11, the helicopter carrying Ms. Yousafzai landed near her family's home in Mingora under strict security measures. Mrs. Yousafzai went to Pakistan three days ago for the first time after she suffered serious injuries due to the Taliban attack. An informed source told AFP that the details of Malala Yousafzai's visit to Pakistan have been kept secret due to the "sensitivity" of the matter. Ms. Yousafzai's trip to her hometown of Mingora was not announced in advance, and for security reasons it was not known whether she would visit her relatives in Swat Valley, a region in northwestern Pakistan. Ms. Yousafzai, who now lives in London, was shot by the Taliban in 2012 for opposing the ban on girls' education. Now 20, he was attacked while riding a school bus at the age of 15 in Swat, his hometown, which was once a base for Taliban fighters. His visit to Pakistan is expected to last for four days. Local media have reported that Malala Foundation officials are also accompanying her on this trip. At the age of 11, Malala Yousafzai was writing notes for the BBC's Urdu section about life under Taliban rule in an anonymous blog. On this blog, he talked about the right to education of girls in this era. The Taliban's attack on this activist for the right to education made Malala's story attract the attention of the world. The Pakistani Taliban said at the time that it targeted him because he was "supporting the West and promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas." Malala was seriously injured in the head during this attack. After emergency treatment was performed on him at the Pakistan Military Hospital, he was transferred to a hospital in Birmingham, England for further treatment and has been living in this city with his family ever since. Because of this attack, part of Malala's face was paralyzed and she lost part of her hearing. Together with her father, she founded the Malala Foundation, which aims to work for a world where every girl has the right to education without fear. In 2014, he was the youngest person to jointly win the Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi. He went to Oxford University to study last year and continues his activities while studying. Mrs. Yousafzai will remain in the history of Pakistan as a figure who divided the society into two opposite poles. While he is supported by the majority of Pakistanis, he is heavily criticized by those who say he has disgraced his country.\nDocument [10]: Five teenagers who changed the world Photo copyright Getty Images Image caption These young people know what to do, most of the time we call teenagers indifferent and selfish. But the new generation of young activists has proven that many teenagers, in fact, deeply care about social, political and environmental issues and are ready to do activities in these fields with all their might. One of the most important is Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old environmental activist who, in an interview with the BBC, urged British politicians to "listen to the scientists" on Earth's climate change. Here we mention five inspiring people who left a great impact on the world around them during their teenage years. Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, born in 2003, who has now become the most important voice of climate change activists in the world. In 2018, he brought up the idea of ​​a school strike after his first solo protest in front of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. More than a million students did not go to class to protest the indifference to climate change. Last year, he told the United Nations Climate Change Summit: "Because world leaders are behaving like children, we have to take responsibility that has been on them for a long time. We have to find out what the previous generation did to us. has brought, what a disgrace they have caused that we have to correct it and deal with it. We have to make our voice heard". Greta has spoken openly about how her autism has shaped her activism, and recently joined the Extinction Rebellion in London and addressed the House of Commons. Malala Yousafzai When she was 11 years old, Malala Yousafzai anonymously wrote and published her memories of her life in Pakistan under the Taliban regime in her blog, which soon attracted a lot of attention. Soon after, she spoke publicly about the need for girls to have proper education and training in various places. Three years later, Malala's life changed when a gunman shot her in the head on a school bus because of her activism. This attack not only did not stop him from his activities, but also widened the scope of his activities. His picture was on the cover of Time magazine and in 2014 he became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Yousafzai said at the ceremony of receiving the Nobel Prize: "This prize does not belong to me only, this prize belongs to all the forgotten children who are eager and in need of education and education, this prize is for all the fearful children who want peace. This prize is for all the children who They cry out for change without their voice reaching anywhere. I am standing here to fight for their right and to make their voice heard. Emma Gonzalez In February 2018, an unknown gunman attacked Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing seventeen people. Instead of succumbing to this tragic incident, many teenagers who survived the incident launched a national campaign against armed violence. Emma Gonzalez,\n\nReport:

Countries neighboring China are closing their borders due to the 2019-nCoV coronavirus epidemic, and some states are sending all arrivals from China into quarantine. Vesti.Nauka suggests recalling the history of quarantines, going back thousands of years. Not long ago, Russia partially closed its border with China due to the 2019-nCoV coronavirus epidemic. Other states neighboring the Celestial Empire took similar measures. And in the United States, everyone arriving from China is sent to a two-week quarantine. "33Live.RuScience" suggests recalling the history of quarantines, going back thousands of years. Surprisingly, the true nature of infections began to become clear only in the 19th century, with the discovery of microorganisms by the brilliant Louis Pasteur. But thousands of years before this, people realized that the healthy were infected with certain ailments from the sick. Quarantine measures were mentioned in the Old Testament. Some parts of it talk about the need to isolate lepers, that is, those with leprosy. In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church throughout Europe organized colonies for people with leprosy. World culture owes the very word “quarantine” to the Black Death epidemic. This plague pandemic began in Central Asia and reached European shores in 1347. According to various estimates, it claimed from 75 to 200 million lives worldwide, including from a third to half of the population of Europe. In 1377, an unusual measure was introduced in the seaport of Ragusa (now the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia). A ship arriving from an area where there were many cases of plague was not allowed to dock for 30 days. It was assumed that during this time anyone carrying the disease would either die or recover. Subsequently, the period was increased to 40 days. The word “quarantine” (Italian quarantena, French quarantaine) comes from the Italian word quaranta (“forty”). The nature of infections began to become clear thanks to the brilliant Louis Pasteur. Illustration by Wikimedia Commons. History has known cases when entire communities of people voluntarily self-isolated in order do not release a dangerous disease into the outside world. Thus, grateful descendants preserved the memory of the feat of the inhabitants of the English village of Iam. In 1665, the plague came to this village. The source of the infection was a parcel sent from London (plague fleas probably made their deadly journey in it). The epidemic was already flaring up in Foggy Albion, but mainly on the southern coast. Iem became one of the first outbreaks in the center of the country. Villagers could have fled from danger, as they did everywhere. The healthy would have avoided infection, but those who were already dangerous would have fled along with them, and the disease would have spread throughout the country. Instead, the inhabitants vowed not to leave the borders of Iem while at least one infected person remained there. For most of them, still healthy, this meant certain death. The selfless British did not leave the village, even to clear the fields. Neighboring residents brought them provisions to the borders of the\nDocument [2]: In the Irkutsk region, a woman with tuberculosis was forcibly hospitalized. In the Irkutsk region, a woman with tuberculosis was forcibly hospitalized. A woman refused treatment. In the Bokhansky district, the prosecutor's office legally forced a woman infected with tuberculosis to undergo mandatory examination and treatment at the Ust-Ordynsk regional anti-tuberculosis dispensary. It turned out that a local resident, sick with tuberculosis, which is contagious, unreasonably refused treatment and violated the sanitary and anti-epidemic regime. Thus, she exposed the people who lived with her and the people with whom she interacted with the risk of contracting tuberculosis. - The particularly dangerous nature of the situation lies in the fact that with tuberculosis, this infection is spread by airborne droplets, and during everyday communication with a sick person, this infection can be transmitted to a significant number of people. Thus, the right of every citizen of the Russian Federation to health protection, guaranteed by Art. 7 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation,” explained the press service of the prosecutor’s office of the Irkutsk region.\nDocument [3]: Tuberculosis is on the doorstep of Europe. Constant cough, fatigue, weight loss. It is not obvious to everyone, but these are symptoms of tuberculosis. Every minute it claims the lives of three people. According to experts, a third of people suffering from this insidious disease do not know about their diagnosis and do not seek medical help, infecting others. And many of those who undergo treatment do not get better. Resistance to the effects of drugs is growing. The disease carries a “potential risk of catastrophic consequences for global security,” warn researchers at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. “Tuberculosis is transmitted by airborne droplets. You can become infected with it anywhere. The best way to prevent infection of the population of a particular country is to fight tuberculosis where it originated. After all, due to migration processes, anyone can get sick. It’s time for the governments of countries to wake up.” Eliud Vandvalo Coordinator, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Over time, bacteria and viruses naturally learn to resist treatments designed to kill them. The situation gets worse if medications are not taken properly. Patients suffering from tuberculosis must undergo several courses of antibiotic treatment for six months. There are also side effects. Another problem: tuberculosis most often affects residents of poor countries. Johnson & Johnson's TB drug, released in 2012, was the first drug approved in 40 years. It is high time for the world to update its toolkit, adding new available vaccines, diagnostic and treatment methods. "It's very expensive - as expensive as developing a cancer drug or an immunodrug. It requires the same time investment, the same effort. It is very difficult to achieve billions of dollars in investment in a program to combat tuberculosis." Paul Stoffels Senior Scientist at Johnson & Johnson But the problem has become too serious to ignore. Every year, drug-resistant tuberculosis kills almost 250 thousand people. It is already on the doorstep of Europe: In Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan, about a quarter of those infected are diagnosed with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Last year, the UN General Assembly pledged to step up the fight and end the epidemic by 2030. But experts state that the world is still very far from achieving this goal.\nDocument [4]: The 10 Deadliest Diseases in Human History The most terrible epidemics in human history have claimed hundreds of millions of lives, sometimes wiping out entire nations. Here is a list of the 10 most famous and dangerous diseases that we have ever encountered. Typhus. One of the most dangerous diseases caused by the bacterium Rickettsia. The name comes from the Greek typhos, which means “smoky or foggy.” The first reliable description of the disease dates back to the Spanish siege of Moorish Granada in 1489. These records include descriptions of fever and red spots on the arms, back and chest, progressing to delirium, necrotic wounds and the stench of rotting flesh. During that siege, the Spanish lost 3,000 men in fighting, but another 17,000 died of typhus. Epidemics occurred throughout Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries, as well as during the English Civil War, the Thirty Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. During the Thirty Years' War of 1618–1648 alone, approximately 8 million Germans were exterminated by bubonic plague and typhus. During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, more French soldiers died of typhus than were killed by Russian troops. One of the most dangerous diseases caused by the bacterium Rickettsia.

In its most serious One of the most dangerous diseases, causing serious epidemics. In its most serious form, cholera can be fatal. If treatment is not provided within three hours, the infected person may die. Signs include diarrhea, shock, nosebleeds, leg cramps, vomiting and dry skin. The first outbreak of cholera was reported in Bengal, and from there it spread to India, China, Indonesia and the Caspian Sea. When the pandemic finally ended in 1826, there were over 15 million deaths in India alone. Oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics currently treat this disease successfully. Smallpox. Smallpox is believed to have started infecting people as early as 10,000 BC. e. However, serious smallpox epidemics began much later. In England during the 18th century, the disease killed approximately 400,000 people every year and caused many cases of blindness. The main symptom is an outbreak of small sores throughout the body. Other symptoms include vomiting, back pain, fever and headache. The earliest symptom of smallpox\nDocument [5]: A pandemic at all times: tough measures, sarcastic signs and tricks of the authorities For many centuries, deadly viruses have tested humanity's strength. Having surpassed world wars and cataclysms in the number of victims, pandemics have claimed hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of lives. At different times, the governments of disease-stricken countries came up with various tricks to prevent the spread of infection. Some immediately introduced strict measures, closing all entertainment venues, others placed special supervisors on the streets designed to check the presence of vaccinations on the body of citizens, and others limited themselves to the recommendation to wear protective masks. For example, during the tuberculosis outbreak, resourceful Scottish authorities lured people to get x-rays using lottery tickets with a chance to win a brand new car. Exhausted people saved themselves from viruses and quarantine boredom by any means. People walked around the city with signs bearing daring slogans, held underground parties, changed their hairstyles in barber shops that had not yet closed, and played with the designs of protective masks. About the ingenuity of the authorities and the entertainment of citizens during epidemics long before the outbreak of the new coronavirus - in the Lenty.ru gallery. Janitors in New York, 1918 The United States became the source of infection. Military censorship in force for the countries participating in the war prohibited the dissemination of information about the beginning of the epidemic, so Spain was the first to announce an outbreak of influenza in the spring of 1918, observing neutrality in that conflict. This is how the disease got the name “Spanish flu”. London, 1920 Due to the developed transport links, the flu spread across the planet in the shortest possible time. The authorities of some states introduced strict quarantine measures: schools, courts, theaters and churches were closed, customers were prohibited from entering stores - their orders were taken outside, and interiors in public transport were treated with a special “antiviral” spray. London, 1918 Employees of shops and hairdressing salons were required to serve customers wearing protective medical masks. Ordinary citizens also received recommendations to wear masks in public places: as one employee of the New York Department of Health put it at the time, “it’s better to look ridiculous than to die.” London, 1920 Women workers at the London Telephone Exchange. It is noteworthy that young healthy people aged 20 to 40 often died from the Spanish flu. As a minimum preventive measure, in particular, employees of various organizations and production facilities were instructed to gargle with a special disinfectant, and in some American states, handshakes were banned for the same purpose. Japan, 1920 The spread of the Spanish flu and the massive movement of troops from the countries participating in the First World War accelerated. In different parts of the world - from the USA to Japan and South Africa - entire villages died out. To bury the victims of the pandemic according to all canons, sometimes there were not enough gravediggers. In these cases, common graves were dug and the dead were buried without coffins or monuments.\nDocument [6]: How the creator of the atomic bomb married a dying girl The publishing house Mann, Ivanov and Farber is publishing the book "Genius. The Life and Science of Richard Feynman." Day.Az, with reference to TASS, presents an excerpt with a sad love story between the famous physicist and his school girlfriend. The title of James Glicane's book is an exaggeration: Richard Feynman is considered one of the greatest scientists in history. As Glick writes, Feynman raised physics to a new level, managing to bring quantum mechanics out of a dead end. In addition, the American, who would have turned 100 years old this year, studied the theory of superfluidity (special liquids can flow without friction), the theory of weak interactions in atomic nuclei, the theory of the particles that make up these nuclei, developed computers, and thought about nanomaterials. And these are just his key achievements in physics. Unlike most theoretical scientists, Feynman managed to work on an applied problem. He was one of the main and youngest participants in the Manhattan Project - the project to create the world's first atomic bomb, the most terrible invention of man. Glick writes that Feynman did not feel as strongly responsible for this as the others. Allegedly, he was more concerned that knowledge alienates him from ordinary people who are unaware of the nuclear threat. But Feynman could not be called an ordinary person. A brilliant physicist, he was handsome, witty, rude and a womanizer. In notebooks, he wrote down not insights about the structure of the universe, but the telephone numbers of women. They were thrilled in front of him, but Feynman did not pass by. But for a long time he had only one love, Arlene Greenbaum, whom they met at school. When Feynman proposed to her, he knew that his beloved was doomed. Arlene died a month before the atomic bomb was tested and two months before the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Feynman began to seek solace with other women, but for a long time he wrote letters to his beloved. Medicine of the 20th century was just laying the scientific foundation that physics began to build back in the 17th century. Medical practitioners have enjoyed the power granted to healers throughout human history. They spoke a language that only they understood and wore the robes of medical schools and societies. But their knowledge was nothing more than a mixture of folk beliefs and pseudoscientific facts. Few of those conducting medical research understood the basics of the controlled statistical experiment method. Doctors argued about the possibility of using one or another method of treatment in much the same way as theologians about their hypotheses, citing personal experience, speculative justifications and aesthetic arguments as arguments. Biologists did not study mathematics. The human body still remained a mystery, a kind of “black box”, the contents of which could only be seen by a surgical scalpel or foggy X-rays. Scientists, even at the most basic level, did not really understand what a diet was. The fashionable word vitamin was just coming into use.\nDocument [7]: World Tuberculosis Day https://ria.ru/20210324/tuberkulez-1602286697.html World Tuberculosis Day World Tuberculosis Day Every year on March 24, the world celebrates World Tuberculosis Day to raise awareness society about the danger... RIA Novosti, 03/24/2021 2021-03-24T06:10 2021-03-24T06:10 2021-03-24T06:10 Russia world tuberculosis day tuberculosis certificates /html/head/meta[@name ='og:title']/@content /html/head/meta[@name='og:description']/@content https://cdn24.img.ria.ru/images/07e5/03/16/1602288889_0 :300:3108:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_e752e7bbe6a9ff6ea73bcbc3eaad233a.jpg Every year on March 24, the world celebrates World Tuberculosis Day, designed to raise public awareness of the dangers of this pulmonary disease. World Tuberculosis Day was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) in 1982. The choice of date was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the causative agent of tuberculosis - Koch's bacillus. Since 1998, World Tuberculosis Day has received official support from the UN. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease with airborne transmission. The main source of the pathogen is a person suffering from the bacillary (pulmonary) form of tuberculosis and releasing mycobacteria from the respiratory tract when coughing, sneezing, or talking. To become infected, a person only needs to inhale a small amount of these bacteria. Sometimes infection can occur through household objects, and very rarely - through food, or rather, dairy and meat products from animals with tuberculosis. The tuberculosis bacterium survives both in snow and in the ground, it is not afraid of the effects of alcohol and acids. In a liquid environment it remains viable for up to six months; in a dried state it can also survive for several months, waiting to be transferred to a more favorable environment. Such bacteria die from exposure to high temperatures and from contact with chlorine-containing substances. The development of tuberculosis is promoted by poor nutrition, consumption of toxic products (tobacco, alcohol, drugs), unsatisfactory working and living conditions, and some chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, blood diseases, HIV). On March 24, 1882, German microbiologist Robert Koch made a statement about the discovery of mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was later named Koch's bacillus, or bacillus, in his honor. This discovery significantly expanded the possibilities for diagnosing and treating the disease; March 24 also began to be considered the birthday of phthisiology - the science of tuberculosis. In 1920, the International Union Against Tuberculosis (since 1986 - the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases) was formed, which united representatives of 31 countries. In 1919, microbiologist Albert Calmette and veterinarian Camille Guerin created a vaccine strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for anti-tuberculosis vaccination of people, which was named Bacillus Calmette Gueri BCG or BCG. The BCG vaccine was first administered to a newborn child in 1921. In 1943, the American biochemist Zelman Waksman, together with his colleague Albert Schatz, obtained streptomycin, the first antimicrobial drug that had a detrimental effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since 1946, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been involved in the fight against tuberculosis. In 1993, WHO declared tuberculosis a global problem. To prevent the further spread of the epidemic, a special strategy, Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course – DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course), was developed, aimed at the timely identification and treatment of patients who are most dangerous to others\nDocument [8]: Medical historian: quarantine has helped throughout history You tell students about epidemics of the plague, cholera, many diseases with a much higher mortality rate than the current Covid-19. Would you like to go on a trip now? I probably wouldn't go. Why tempt fate? I am, of course, not the person who is terribly nervous about the current viral epidemic and is afraid of getting sick. But airports are now dangerous places that you shouldn’t go to. What disease has claimed the most lives in Estonian history? I think endemics were more deadly than epidemics. An endemic disease is called “local” in Estonian and means an illness that is constantly present in the population. The curse of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe was tuberculosis. Let us at least remember Tallinn a hundred years ago, about tiny residential houses. Today Kalamaja is home to hipsters, but in the old days there was hell in every room of the house, ten people lived there. These working families were the environment for the spread of tuberculosis. Mortality rates among infants and young children were high, whether from diarrhea, diphtheria, or other childhood diseases. What was the deadliest epidemic? I think it's a plague. There was no such thing in Estonia for 300 years, the last one happened during the Great Northern War, but it was still very deadly. It is mentioned that the disease that has killed the most people in history is malaria. Today we consider malaria mainly a disease of hot countries, but 200–300 years ago malaria was also common in Estonia. Why did she disappear from Estonia? Hard to tell. The drainage of the land and the digging of ditches that Tammsaare spoke about could have played a role. The carrier of malaria is a mosquito that needs moisture to reproduce. Perhaps the fact that people no longer live with animals in barns, where there were favorable wintering opportunities for mosquitoes that spread malaria, played a role. Let's look into history: what measures turned out to be the most effective during epidemics? All the same quarantines and isolations. Already in medieval Tallinn they understood that this or that disease came to us on ships. The ships were quarantined and kept in Paljasaare. During outbreaks, attempts were also made to stop movement and movement.\nDocument [9]: “Big surprise” People are really surprised to hear that there is a tuberculosis epidemic in Ukraine. An even bigger surprise is the numbers: every day 90 Ukrainians fall ill with tuberculosis, 27 die. We hide something obscene or dirty, even incomprehensible, everything that we don’t want to show in public, in attics, in corners, in secret drawers, cover it with dark sheets, and hastily paint it over. That is, we pretend that something simply does not exist. Even when “it” is sewn with white thread. People are not used to talking about things that they cannot cope with on their own. Just as many of us are afraid to go to the doctor, lest we hear a terrible diagnosis in his office, so the state postpones until tomorrow, until later, issues on which the life and health of every Ukrainian often depends. So we live blindly. It seems to us, as children, that if we cover our eyes with our palms, then no one will see, hear, or feel anything. Actually this is not true. There are problems in society that are useless to hide. They still come out somewhere like yeast dough from a bad housewife. And suddenly the time comes when a huge problem, which has become crowded in the bowl, bursts out. Then there are no words for explanations or justifications. By law, black paint absorbs all other colors. Nowadays in Ukraine, tuberculosis is called a “silent epidemic”. It’s as if the disease lives its own separate life within the walls of hospitals. Experts say that in the 1980s in the USSR tuberculosis was controlled. This is how it now remains in the vast majority of the territories of the European Union. There are very few countries in the West where this disease has truly been overcome. Professor Vasily Melnik, Deputy Director of the Institute of Phthisiology and Pulmonology named after. F. Yanevsky says that in order to get tuberculosis, you need not just to have direct contact with an infected person (and we have approximately 90% of these among the adult population), but a genetic predisposition. However, if thirty years ago there was a more or less complete picture of the number of patients in the state - people regularly did fluorography, and doctors detected the disease in the early stages, which means they treated it faster and easier, now we confuse BCG vaccination and the Mantoux test. And what can we say about stress, poor nutrition and poor working conditions! But all this constitutes a favorable situation for the development of tuberculosis infection. In conditions of ignorance and the life of various myths, fear is born, and fear quickly seeks out a feeling of shame. This is not to say that being afraid (and even embarrassed) of tuberculosis is not natural. This is how a certain defense mechanism works. Therefore, such sensations can be explained. No one justified anyone when society labeled them as “tubes.” Eventually, it got used to this practice. But in reality, this word contains something terrible and at the same time incomprehensible. We\nDocument [10]: Why can you die from a small wound or fracture? Can you imagine that an ordinary wound on the knee or an open fracture of the arm will result in fatal consequences? Of course not, most people think. And he is very wrong. It turns out that the human body is designed in such a way that under certain circumstances it naturally kills itself. How this happens and whether it is possible to prevent a tragedy - Andrei Kravtsov, candidate of medical sciences, orthopedic traumatologist of the highest category, spoke in an exclusive interview with 5-tv.ru. Dangerous microbes Infectious lesions of the skeleton - this is the name of the problem that arises as a result of trauma. It's no secret that a lot of microbes live in the environment. We are talking, in particular, about staphylococci, streptococci and other pathogenic bacteria. Entering the body through a wound or injury, they immediately begin to multiply and take over new territories, simultaneously causing harm to the new “master”. If the infection has not been able to take root, there is virtually nothing to worry about. But if it settles on the bones, immediate medical intervention is required. “This is a purulent bone wound. Surgeons deal with this every day and have extensive experience in treating such conditions,” said Kravtsov. He added that in some cases the course of the disease worsens significantly. This is due to the lack of immunity in the patient and the formation of an endogenous infection. That is, in situations where a person is killed not by the microbes that got into the wound from the outside, but by those that were in the body and previously worked for creation, but suddenly began to destroy everything. “For what reason is immunity impaired? This could be a serious illness, malnutrition, or HIV infection. Usually the microbe is destroyed by our defenses, but here it can settle in the bones and begin to develop there. This condition is called osteomyelitis. With it, both bones and bone marrow are affected simultaneously,” the doctor explained. Is it possible to save? Andrey Kravtsov noted that with an infectious lesion of the skeleton, the patient experiences terrible pain. As a result of this disease, bone tissue is significantly affected, severe purulent inflammation occurs, and the functioning of all internal organs and tissues is disrupted. If you do not help the patient in a short time, he will die. But there are some nuances here too. The doctor notes that conventional therapy for infectious lesions of the skeleton is powerless. Even the strongest antibiotics will not help a person. The only way out of this difficult situation is surgery. “This is a very serious disease. It is imperative to open, drain and excise lesions that have been damaged,” the traumatologist emphasized. He added that the group of specific infectious diseases that increase mortality also includes syphilis, brucellosis, and tuberculosis. But unlike an endogenous infection, they can actually be cured in a hospital setting. Kravtsov noted that osteomyelitis, like the familiar tuberculosis, does not arise spontaneously.

The authorities of the state of Texas warned the citizens of this city about using tap water. According to the BBC report, after conducting several tests, it was found that the microbe "Naegleria fowleri" or "brain-eating amoeba" is present in the water of this city. This amoeba can cause brain infection and is therefore fatal. Lake Jackson officials have said they are disinfecting water equipment; But it is not clear how much time this issue will take. According to this report, eight groups of Texas residents were warned about using these waters on Friday night. Based on this, these people were told not to use tap water in any way, except for the "flush tank of toilets". The warning was lifted for the entire state of Texas on Saturday; But it still remains in force for the residents of the city of "Lake Jackson", where more than 27 thousand people live. City officials have also warned that children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. City officials said they are cleaning the water supply and will then conduct tests to ensure the city's water is safe for public use. According to the BBC, an investigation into the city's water supply system was launched after a six-year-old child was infected with the germ and then died earlier this month. Also, the American website "WebMD" announced that a ten-year-old girl died due to Naglieria fowleri, which is known as "brain-eating amoeba". According to this website, although it is not clear where this girl contracted this microbe, it was reported that she had swam in a river near her house shortly before contracting the disease.

East of this state has been identified. Late on Friday, the Texas Environmental Quality Commission issued a statement warning about the presence of the brain-eating amoeba or Naegleria fowleri, and by issuing a statement, people were asked not to use the water until further notice. Currently, the Texas counties of Lake Jackson, Freeport, Angleton, Brazoria, Richwood, Oyster Creek, Cloete and Rosenberg are subject to this notice. Surveys show that the drinking water of seven cities is without problems; But the water in Jackson Lake is not safe enough. Also, the residents of this area have been asked to refrain from consuming water in this area. The contamination of drinking water in the Jackson Lake area was announced after a six-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital and died two days later due to the identification of this amoeba in his body. Brain-eating amoebas are found in rivers and hot springs and do not enter the body by swallowing contaminated water. If contaminated water enters the throat from the nose, this deadly amoeba enters the brain and causes death after acute inflammation in the meninges and spinal cord. This is not the first time that American people are faced with contaminated water and such incidents have happened before. end of message/\nDocument [3]: The discovery of a deadly microbe in the Texas water tank Following the discovery of a deadly microbe in the public water supply of the city of "Lake Jackson", Texas, the residents of this city have been warned about using tap water. According to ISNA, the results of tests have confirmed the presence of "Nagliria fowleri" microbe in the piped water system of Lake Jackson, USA. This brain-eating amoeba can cause a type of brain infection and is usually fatal. This infection is rare in the United States, with 34 cases reported from 2009 to 2018. Local officials in Lake Jackson have said they are disinfecting the water supply, but don't know how long that process will take. Initially on Friday night, residents of eight counties in Texas were told not to use the water for any reason other than flushing the toilet. Sometime later, Lake Jackson officials announced that people could use the water, but they had to boil it before drinking. Residents were also told to take other precautions, including not letting water run up their noses when showering or bathing. City officials have also warned that children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable. According to officials, the city's water system is being flushed and after that tests will be done to make sure the water is safe. City manager Lake Jackson told reporters that an investigation into the city's water supply began after a six-year-old child was infected with this microbe and died earlier this month. The amoeba Nagliria fowleri occurs naturally in fresh water and is found worldwide. Usually, when contaminated water enters people's body through the nose and goes to the brain, it infects them. There is no possibility of contracting this infection by swallowing it, and it is not transmitted from person to person. In people who are infected with Nagliria fowleri, symptoms such as fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as stiffness and dryness of the neck and headache occur. Most patients with this infection die within a week. According to the BBC news channel, the disease was previously confirmed in the state of Florida in the United States. At that time, health authorities asked local people to avoid nose contact with water from taps and other sources. end of message\nDocument [4]: There was no report of the outbreak of fasciola disease in Mazandaran. Dr. Mohammad Reza Parsaei, in an interview with IRNA reporter on Tuesday, added: fasciola is an infectious disease caused by the fasciola parasite, which can spread to humans through the consumption of vegetables and even contaminated water, but in 2 In recent years, there has been no report on the identification of a patient infected with this parasite at the health and treatment centers of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. He added: In any case, this infectious disease is one of the common diseases in the spring season for the northern provinces of the country, including Mazandaran province, which should be noticed by the citizens of the province to avoid consuming stale vegetables and contaminated water, including springs. Refrain. Dr. Parsaei stated that the long incubation period of this disease and the increase in people's awareness of self-care and the observance of health tips in the consumption of vegetables are the main reasons for the non-spread of this disease in Mazandaran province in the last two years. What is fasciola or liver rot? Fascioliasis is a common parasitic infection between humans and animals caused by Fasciola parasitic worms, which people in the local dialect also know as sheep tapeworms. Fasciola parasites are flat and leaf-shaped worms that live mainly in the bile ducts of the liver of animals, including sheep and goats. , cows, buffaloes and some other herbivores live and two types of this parasite infect people. Its main species is Fasciola hepatica or common liver parasite or sheep liver parasite. This infectious disease is found in more than 70 countries of the world, especially in areas where sheep or cattle are raised. Fasciola hepatica is found in all continents except Antarctica and Fasciola gigantica is found in some tropical regions. Humans get this parasitic disease by eating contaminated vegetables and plants and contaminated water, such as drinking it or eating vegetables that have been washed or irrigated with contaminated water. Although this parasitic disease is not contagious, they get this infectious disease by eating sheep meat, especially liver, which contains the Nalagh fasciolast parasite, and the clinical symptoms of this disease can include fever, weakness, abdominal pain, eosinophilia, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). be Symptoms of the disease in humans: fever of 40-42 degrees Celsius, which is usually the first symptom of the disease that appears, pain in the abdomen, digestive system disorders such as diarrhea, nausea and abdominal bloating and hives, respiratory symptoms (rarely occurs) such as cough, tightness Breath, bloody sputum, enlarged liver and spleen, watery stomach, anemia, jaundice. The economic damage caused by this disease worldwide is estimated at 2.3 billion US dollars. This disease is now considered one of the human diseases and according to the World Health Organization, about 2.4 million people are infected with Fasciola and 180 million other people are at risk of infection.\nDocument [5]: Storage of 15 million larval posts in shrimp breeding centers in Abadan, according to Mehr reporter, Fethullah Abu Ali, on the sidelines of a visit to the Choebdeh shrimp breeding complex in Abadan, said: White spot disease has progressed to the point of closing this complex, but with the help of local experts and The use of today's technologies and also with the help and assistance of users, solutions were implemented in this field to overcome this problem and manage the disease. According to the Director General of Khuzestan Fisheries, this disease exists all over the world and cannot be eradicated. He added: In this regard, management in farms should be doubled and production should continue with knowledge and awareness that this disease exists. Abu Ali stated that the use of the nursery plan is one of the ways out of this problem and said: Last year, for the first time, two million and 300 thousand pieces of nursery post larvae were given to the farms to continue breeding and valuable results were obtained, in other words, in this No diseases were observed in the farms and the average production also increased. He added: The issue of using the nursery plan is to allow the larvae to reach a weight of more than one gram in a limited greenhouse environment outside the breeding season and enter the breeding fields. The Director General of Khuzestan Fisheries listed the main advantages of this project as the shortening of the breeding period, the possibility of simultaneous harvesting of several crops throughout the year and the control and management of diseases and said: This year, the nursery project has started earlier than last year in three centers and it is hoped that it will be completed by the end of the year. Season, the second phase of this plan should be with the same capacity or a little less, and in total, we will implement the nursery plan with at least 25 million larva posts, which will grow more than 10 times compared to last year. Abu Ali considered the implementation of the nursery project as the way to save the Choebde complex in Abadan and stated: the start of this project has strengthened the motivation of operators to set up stagnant and abandoned centers; It is also predicted that this year the number of shrimp farms will grow by 50% and their cultivated area by 100%. Director General of Khuzestan Fisheries added: For the first time in the country, a nursery level with 25 million pieces of post-larvae and using the bioflak method has been done in this complex. He considered one of the most important measures this year to be the establishment of breeding centers and said: 9 breeding centers have been stagnant in this complex, and this year one unit entered the production cycle, and with the activation of other centers in the coming years, there will definitely be post larvae. We supply the needs of breeding farms in the province.

Super acute birds have fully informed. He added: Based on this, at the end of November of this year, three foci of super-acute bird flu disease were detected in the country at the same time, in these foci, which were in Mazandaran, Aslandoz region of Ardabil, and Mighan lagoon of the central province, there were reports of deaths of migratory wild birds. It was announced that after the sampling, the disease was confirmed in them. This official added: "Fortunately, no new case was observed in Aslandoz region after the initial outbreak was cleared." But in Mazandaran, some time later, this disease was observed in two birds in Feridoonkar region, which was quickly resolved because their number was small, and we do not have any new cases. What was the story of Mallard? Naqeibi said: "The number of casualties has also decreased in Miqan, and according to the latest news we have, the number of casualties has reached 7-8 per day, and the total number of casualties in this area is more than 1,100." In another part of his speech, referring to the reports submitted about the observation of several infected centers in Mallard, this official also said: In Mallard, a center was identified in a village called "Said Castle", where around 600 pieces of turkey were kept illegally. and there was another case in this city and in Jafarieh town where about 10 chickens and roosters were kept in a garden house where there were two or three casualties and the owner immediately informed us that the samplings were done It indicated the occurrence of super acute bird flu in this center. Saying that fortunately, no industrial unit has been infected with this disease and no new case has been reported in native poultry or wildlife, Naqibi said: However, our monitoring is carried out in line with the monitoring program that we have until May. In 1400, this monitoring program continues. Migratory birds also gradually return in the middle and end of March, and thus the situation gradually improves. Emphasizing that we take great care not to infect industrial units, Naqibi said: If this happens, something like the year 2016 may happen, when about 27 million poultry perished and we had serious problems in egg production. . Pointing out that there are reports from different parts of the world that the disease is rampant and new cases are being reported from all over the world every day, this official added: The conditions are not favorable in Japan either, and this country has about three million people. Extermination has been done and wild birds can bring this disease into our country without showing any symptoms. 4 advice to the\nDocument [10]: Adherence to protocols is a necessary condition for seeing and visiting because the presence of the corona virus in family gatherings can exponentially infect people with the disease of Covid-19, and therefore compliance with health protocols, including the use of masks and maintaining social distance, is the least thing that should be considered. be placed The importance of this issue becomes more clear when we know that due to the new mutated strain of the corona virus, sicker patients go to health and treatment centers, and this new strain has a higher contagious power and a logarithmic transmission power in gathering centers, including family gatherings. Perhaps this is the reason why some people refuse to visit, but on the other hand, others are not only indifferent to the corona situation of Nowruz 1400, but they also do not pay attention to health recommendations and protocols, or at best they are not aware of them. What can we do to prevent progressive infection? Wearing a mask and observing social distance should not be forgotten in sightings and visits, and along with them, we should pay attention to the important point that long-term presence in a covered and closed space and the lack of proper ventilation can also increase the possibility of transmission; Therefore, it seems necessary to open the window and shorten the viewing time. With the assumption that the presence in the home of the elders is one of the characteristics of the market and the visits of Nurzi, experts emphasize the attention to the health of this group and also remind the issue that old age is one of the high-risk factors in people. Disinfecting or washing your hands before entering the house and paying attention to the useful time and the correct way to use a mask are other things that should be taken into account when visiting Nowruz according to the advice of experts. Even the presidents of the universities of medical sciences across the country in a message have asked the intelligent people of our country to be vigilant in these days to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 disease and to prevent the spread of the disease by observing health restrictions and protocols in order to join the defenders of health. . This message states: "Seriousness in using the mask correctly, maintaining social distance in the community, avoiding gathering in places without ventilation and avoiding unnecessary traffic can do miracles; "Especially because on the eve of Nowruz holidays, new mutations of this mysterious virus have doubled the threats caused by the disease, and any travel and traffic increases the chance of new areas being infected with the mutated virus." The seriousness of the risk of infection These days, we are witnessing the formation of new disease clusters in some provinces, and the risk of contracting a new mutated strain of the corona virus is very serious. As far as the spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education announced yesterday, March 30, 2019, that unfortunately, during the previous 24 hours, 75 Covid-19 patients have died\n\nReport:

The American centers that deal with disease control have warned that a disease that affects the central nervous system continues to rapidly spread in the United States, reports the portal WWW.PLANETANOVOSTI.COM. The causative agent of the disease is Naegleria fowleri, followed by Experts have been monitoring it for 10 years; it is spreading very quickly. At the same time, scientists noted that the trajectory of the pathogen’s spread may be affected by climate change. Due to the sharp increase in air temperature, the amoeba feels just fine, which might not have happened under other conditions. It lives in warm freshwater systems and soil. A pathogen of this type can cause a very serious condition called amoebic meningoencephalitis. As a result of infection, not only inflammation develops, but also complete destruction of the brain. To date, only five patients have survived the disease in North America. Recently, two cases of infection have been recorded that resulted in death. The victim was a thirteen-year-old child from Florida who died a few days after entering the body. The second victim was a 6-year-old child who lived in Texas. Because of this, the city of Lake Jackson's water supply is now being thoroughly disinfected to eliminate Naegleria fowleri completely. Jennifer Cope, who is a medical officer for the department's waterborne disease prevention department, said the amoeba could be getting into the municipal supply system. naturally from soil or rivers. Most often this happens if there are some irregularities in its work. For example, when a pipe in the system ruptures. The specialist also added that every year in the United States several cases of infection are recorded due to the fact that a huge number of people visit places for recreation and swimming. At the same time, the number of infections remains stable over time. In addition, Cope warned that the amoeba has now begun to move towards the north, where cases of diseases among local residents have recently begun to be increasingly recorded.\nDocument [2]: In Texas, a girl became a victim of a brain-damaging amoeba after swimming in a river.

According to ABC News, Lily Mae Avant is in critical condition - the child's brain is affected by the amoeba Naegleria Fowler. The rare “brain-eating amoeba” lives in warm fresh water: in rivers, lakes, and streams. The single-celled organism enters the brain through the nose and causes amoebic meningoencephalitis. It is reported that the girl took a swim in the river near her home and soon felt a headache. In the following days, she began to behave strangely, and in a semi-conscious state she was sent to the hospital, where she was placed in a medically induced coma.

In the United States of America, in the state of Texas in the city of Lake Jackson, a deadly microbe was found in the city water supply that affects brain function. The amoeba Naegleria fowleri can have fatal consequences. As reported by the news portal Tomorrow, in cities such as Lake Jackson, Freeport, Angleton, Brazoria, Richwood, Oyster Creek, Clute and Rosenberg on Friday, September 25, it was prohibited to use water for any purpose other than flushing toilets. However, the next day the ban was lifted and remained only in Lake Jackson. The state authorities have already announced that the water undergoes the necessary disinfection, but before use it must be boiled for prevention. Doctors emphasized that the risk group includes children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems, as they are especially vulnerable to this microbe. In early September, a six-year-old boy died from Naegleria fowleri infection. At this time, the water supply is being properly flushed and disinfected to allow for re-testing. People infected with Naegleria fowleri experience symptoms such as fever, nausea and vomiting, and headaches. Most people infected die within a week.\nDocument [5]: Amoebic meningoencephalitis is spreading in the United States due to climate change. A microorganism that is causing irreversible changes in the human body is spreading in the United States. Dangerous amoebas are spreading across the United States due to climate change. Science Alert talks about this. Scientists came to this conclusion after studying cases of the disease for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, which is caused by a certain type of amoebae. Until recently, the number of diseases remained at approximately the same level in certain regions. Now, researchers have discovered changes in the geographic distribution of the disease - the deadly bacteria has spread north, and can now be affected in the Midwestern states. The single-celled Naegleria fowleri is usually found in warm, fresh water. Infection occurs when fluid containing protozoa enters the nose and then to the brain through the olfactory nerves, where the protozoa begin to multiply and spread throughout the body. Amoeba infection manifests itself violently and unexpectedly - the patient develops a fever, the senses of smell and taste disappear, migraines, convulsions and vomiting begin, and consciousness is impaired. A person dies within 2-7 days due to destruction of the brain, lungs and breathing problems. Since it is impossible to detect pockets of amoeba populations, the only preventive measure may be to avoid swimming in warm, fresh water. If it is impossible to avoid contact with water, scientists advise covering your nose or keeping your head down - the amoeba will not be able to reach the brain through the mouth and other openings. Earlier, “Comments” wrote that an epidemic of influenza and ARVI was beginning in Ukraine. In addition, the portal learned that the authorities of the United Kingdom of Great Britain informed the world community about the discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in the southeast of the country.

A ten-year-old resident of Texas (USA) died after swimming in the river. The girl became infected with an amoeba that eats the brain. This was reported by Gazeta.ru with reference to CNN. The child became infected with the amoeba while swimming in the river. A week after the holiday, the American woman developed a headache. The girl was taken to the hospital, tests were done and she was found to have the Naegleria Fowler parasite. This amoeba lives in warm fresh water: rivers, lakes and streams. It enters the human brain through the nose. Doctors put the American woman into a medically induced coma, but they could not save her. Doctors said that when infected with Naegleria Fowler, the mortality rate is 97%.\nDocument [7]: Killer amoeba ate the brains of 500 people Since the beginning of the year, six Americans have already died due to the lake killer amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Having come into contact with a person, it reaches the brain and devours its cells. THIS dangerous creature lives in the shallows of warm lakes with stagnant water. The amoeba enters the body through the nasopharynx during bathing. It attaches to the cranial nerve and then moves towards the brain. At first, those infected complain of a mild headache. After a few days, they begin to experience pain in the neck and fever. Soon signs of brain damage appear - hallucinations, strange behavior. Death occurs two weeks after infection. The victim has almost no chance of survival; there is no treatment for the amoeba. Presumably, Naegleria fowleri is the result of a mutation. It was first discovered in Australia in the 60s. last century. Since then, it has “spread” to other continents. According to the American Center for Epidemic Control, Naegleria fowleri has already killed more than 500 people. For some unknown reason, boys are most often the victims. This dangerous creature has not yet reached Russia.\nDocument [8]: In Florida, a person has been infected with a brain-eating microorganism Tallahassee, USA, , 15:57 — REGNUM A case of a person being infected with a “brain-eating” single-celled organism has been recorded in the US state of Florida. This was announced by the state health department, CBS News reported on July 5. The dangerous microorganism Naegleria fowleri was discovered in a resident of Hillsborough County. According to the department, since 1962, only 37 cases of infection with such a microorganism have been recorded. Infection with Naegleria fowleri is highly likely to be fatal: of the 145 known cases of infection in the United States, the death of the patient was avoided in only four cases. The single-celled organism lives in warm, fresh water, such as lakes, rivers and hot springs. Peak season in Florida is July, August and September, the health department said. The microorganism develops best at a temperature of 45 degrees Celsius. Naegleria fowleri infection occurs when contaminated water enters a person's nose. Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri infection include severe pain in the front of the head, fever, nausea and vomiting. Later symptoms may also include a stiff neck, seizures, changes in mental status, hallucinations, and coma. Signs of infection usually begin a few days after swimming or otherwise exposing the nose to contaminated water. Death occurs within 1–18 days after the onset of symptoms.\nDocument [9]: In one of the US cities, a rare brain-eating amoeba was found in the water supply.

Later, local authorities allowed the use of water, but only after boiling. It is also recommended to avoid getting it into your nose.\nDocument [10]: You can bring an amoeba from the sea that eats away the brain. Salty sea water is by default considered safer than fresh, stagnant water - in the latter, they say, a lot of things happen during the swimming season. However, global warming has done its dirty work, and splashing on sea beaches is now also dangerous. And it's not about the risk of drowning or stepping on a sea urchin. Scientists warn about the spread of dangerous bacteria that live mainly in warm waters. “Flesh Eater” This summer, several fatal cases of infection with the dangerous microorganisms Vibrio vulnificus, the amoeba Naegleria fowleri and the parasite Cryptosporidium have been recorded. Vibrio vulnificus, also known as the “flesh eater,” poses a new threat to beachgoers. According to scientists, due to climate change, the bacterium has appeared in places where it was not previously found. In fact, it lives in ocean waters, the temperature of which exceeds 13 ° C, and now it has looked into the resort bays. You can become infected with the bacteria in two ways: if you eat insufficiently cooked/fried seafood, and also through wounds and abrasions on the body when swimming. The bacterium attacks tendons and soft tissues, causing patients to develop necrotizing fasciitis - inflammation of the tendons with necrosis (death). As a result, patients have to remove dead tissue and even have limbs amputated. In more severe cases, the infection enters the blood and spreads throughout the body. This can be fatal. In order to prevent infection with Vibrio vulnificus, persons with wounds or scratches should avoid open water, and do not eat raw or poorly processed seafood. Persons with reduced immunity and liver disease are most susceptible to infection. Vibrio vulnificus under a microscope. Photo: GLOBAL LOOK PRESS Serve up your hemispheres! Another exotic parasite, Naegleria Fowleri, or the brain-eating amoeba, lives in warm water and feeds exclusively on bacteria. It can be found at the bottom of reservoirs, among thickets of silt, where it descends in search of food. Infections caused by Naegleria Fowleri are uncommon. However, they are very dangerous and cause death. Infection occurs while swimming in a pond. The amoeba enters the nose from where it migrates along the olfactory nerve to the brain, where it causes inflammation of the brain or amoebic meningoencephalitis. The brain is an excellent habitat for an amoeba. It is also warm and humid there, just like in reservoirs. But there are no bacteria there, and in search of food the amoeba begins to attack nerve cells. The immune system tries to protect brain cells. All this leads to inflammation, swelling, and increased intracranial pressure. The patient is worried about fever, nausea, vomiting, a change in sense of smell (as a result of damage to the olfactory nerve), then convulsions and hallucinations occur. Amoeba Naegleria fowleri. The outcome of this disease is tragic for several reasons. The amoeba quickly destroys brain matter. Early symptoms of this disease can be mistaken for viral or bacterial meningitis. There is no diagnostic test that can quickly identify the pathogen.\n\nReport:

After infection, the virus encrypts files on the drive and demands a ransom of $300 in bitcoins. After receiving the ransom, the attackers promise to decrypt the files. The affected companies note that the WannaCrypt virus infection occurred through email. Let's consider how you can protect yourself from infection with this virus and what to do if you still fail to protect yourself. Note that the WannaCrypt virus exploits a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, which Microsoft has fixed in the new version of the operating system (obviously, we are talking about Windows 10). “Our experts have added detection and protection against a new malware known as Ransom:Win32.WannaCrypt. In March, we also introduced additional protection against malware of this nature with a security update that prevents malware from spreading across the network,” Microsoft said. Windows Defender antivirus users are protected from the WannaCrypt virus because it receives updates automatically. Those with Windows Update enabled received updated protection in March 2017. Therefore, the first tip to ensure protection against WannaCrypt is to activate Windows Update and install all updates for the operating system. You can also separately download patch MS17-010 from the Microsoft website, which will close the vulnerability. After installation, you should restart your computer. Also, to ensure protection against the ransomware virus, Microsoft has released updates for older systems for which support has already ended, including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. You can download the update for the desired OS from the Microsoft website. Considering that infection is carried out via email, you should not open attachments in messages received from unknown senders. Especially if the attachment has a .exe or .js extension. You should also not install software obtained from unverified sources on your computer. If you were unable to secure your computer in advance, you should perform several steps to remove the WannaCrypt virus: You need to restart the computer in safe mode loading network drivers. To remove the virus from the system yourself, you can use the following instructions. Or you can turn to antivirus programs like SpyHunter Anti-Malware Tool, Malwarebytes Anti-malware or STOPZilla for help. The last step for the average user is restoring encrypted files, which should only be done after uninstalling WannaCrypt. Otherwise, you may cause damage to system files and registries. To restore files, you can use decryptors, as well as the Shadow Explorer utility (which will return shadow copies of files and the original state of encrypted files) or Stellar Phoenix Windows Data Recovery. However, it should be noted that these methods do not guarantee complete file recovery. Source: tjournal\nDocument [2]: Experts have found out which OS will become the new victim of WannaCry. EternalBlue is one of the “NSA exploits” stolen from the Equation cyber group in 2016. In mid-April 2017, this exploit, along with several others, was distributed by The Shadow Brokers group. Shortly after this, there was a global outbreak of the WannaCry ransomware that used this exploit. A global cyber attack using the WannaCry ransomware virus began on May 12, 2017. The virus infected tens of thousands of computers around the world, including computers of government agencies. All computers based on Windows operating systems younger than version ten are vulnerable to it. Windows 10 has a number of security mechanisms designed to prevent malware from entering the system, and EternalBlue was powerless against them. However, RiskSense experts demonstrated that this exploit can be made to work on Windows 10, although they noted that the March system update MS17-010 is the most effective barrier against malware using EternalBlue.\nDocument [3]: The WannaCry program took computers around the world hostage. Summary The WannaCry program took computers around the world hostage. Generalization Moscow. may 13. INTERFAX.RU - Files on tens of thousands of computers were blocked by the WannaCry ransomware virus. Among the victims are both ordinary users and large companies, as well as government agencies. What is WannaCry The WannaCry program is the so-called Ransomware - software designed for extortion. After installation on the victim’s computer, the program either encrypts some important files, demanding money for instructions and a password for decryption, or blocks the system by displaying a window with threats. WannaCry does both: it encrypts databases, locks the computer, and displays a message demanding that the ransom amount be deposited into the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet. Kaspersky Lab explained that the attack took place through the well-known network vulnerability Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010, after which a set of scripts was installed on the infected system, using which the attackers launched a ransomware program. Ransom amounts vary: hackers demand from $200 to $600. If the victim does not pay the ransom within two days, the amount will be increased. If the user refuses to pay within a week, the encrypted files will be deleted. Judging by the fact that one of these wallets (it is reported that there are several of them) already contains 4 bitcoins (more than $6,700), someone was afraid of the threats: 22 transactions date back to May 13. Experts are already calling the attack on May 12 the largest Ransomware hack with the highest efficiency in the first 8 hours of operation. I think we should wait some days before saying this. But, for sure: there was no RW campaign w/ success like this within the first 8 hours. https://t.co/G4RuOPlVU3 — MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) May 12, 2017 Who suffered The first high-profile case of WannaCry was an attack on part of the Telefonica computer network, which paralyzed it. Those of its employees who were not affected by the attack were warned to turn off their computers, including the computers of external workers connected via VPN. Then WannaCry appeared on the computers of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The attack affected medical facilities in London, as well as the English cities of Blackburn, Nottingham and the counties of Cumbria and Hertfordshire. Because of the attack, some medical facilities warned that they would only accept emergency patients. Later, British Prime Minister Theresa May separately noted that no hospital patient data fell into the hands of attackers. In total, according to the Russian Kaspersky Lab, about 45 thousand attacks were carried out by the WannaCry ransomware in 74 countries around the world. You can see how the virus spread in this infographic from The New York Times.

In just a matter of hours, the virus disabled the computers of many universities and research centers, the National Security Agency and the US Strategic Command, and at NASA the malware almost damaged the space shuttle control system. The Great Worm, so nicknamed for its destructiveness, turned out to be not “the machinations of the Russians,” as the government believed, but the entertainment of an ordinary American student, Robert Morris, who himself surrendered to the police. Yandex. A browser with elements of Rambler, which will protect you from visiting an infected or fraudulent site, and will also block downloaded files if they contain a virus. Antiviruses, firewalls and filters that have appeared since then protect computers around the world. Rambler also cares about the safety of its users, so we recommend using a secure one, which will protect you from visiting an infected or fraudulent site, and will also block downloaded files if they contain a virus. Fourth place: Win95.CIH (Chernobyl) The virus of Taiwanese origin CIH has a second, more well-known name - Chernobyl. He received it because the virus “turned on” only once a year on April 26, on the anniversary of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. For computers, Chernobyl’s destructiveness was comparable: the virus deleted all information on the hard drive and also corrupted the motherboard firmware, which could only be repaired by a specialist with special equipment. On April 26, 1999, CIH destroyed data on half a million computers at once, becoming the worst computer virus of the 20th century. Third place: WannaCry Ransomware worms that demand a ransom for decrypting corrupted files existed before WannaCry, but it was this virus that caused the most damage around the world. To operate, WannaCry used a computer vulnerability known only to the US National Security Agency. The fact of hiding and leaking data about the vulnerability became a scandal for the NSA. open sources Once on the computer, the worm encrypted almost all files with a clever algorithm and demanded a ransom in bitcoins equivalent to $300. If the ransom was not paid within a week, the files were permanently destroyed. However, the hackers did not have time to complete the decryption mechanism after payment, so victims of the virus lost not only all data, but also money. The epidemic was stopped almost by accident: virus analyst Marcus Hutchins discovered a self-destruction mechanism in the virus, which was activated if two previously non-existent sites appeared on the Internet. Marcus quickly registered the necessary domains, stopping the spread of WannaCry. During the epidemic, the virus infected more than 520 thousand computers, causing total damage of $1 billion. Second place: ILOVEYOU On the night of May 4-5, 2000, a new virus called ILOVEYOU began to spread from the Philippines via email. The dangerous letter said that the file attached to it contained a love confession\nDocument [5]: The Boeing company said it was attacked by the WannaCry ransomware. Yesterday, March 29, 2018, The Seattle Times reported that the American Boeing corporation was attacked by the WannaCry ransomware. Journalists cited the words of the chief engineer of Boeing's commercial aircraft department, Mike VanderWel, who said that the malware that had infected the corporation's computers was quickly "metastasizing" and expressed concern that the infection could even affect Boeing's production systems. Many media outlets picked up the news and reported the return of WannaCry, but it seems that the journalists were hasty in their conclusions. The fact is that Boeing representatives soon published a statement on the company’s official Twitter, according to which the press had seriously exaggerated the scale of the incident. The company said that the unnamed malware affected only a few systems, after which the attack was detected and stopped, and the incident did not affect Boeing production in any way. Statement: A number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate. Our cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue. — Boeing Airplanes (@BoeingAirplanes) March 28, 2018 It is worth noting that when talking with journalists from such authoritative publications as The New York Times, Boeing representatives no longer mentioned WannaCry and refused to confirm or deny information that the corporation suffered from an attack of this very thing cryptographer Most likely, there was an error and the ransomware (if the attack actually took place) was only similar to WannaCry. The fact is that WannaCry, the epidemic of which affected thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of users in the summer of 2017, was successfully neutralized by British cybersecurity specialist Marcus Hutchins. Then an emergency “stop valve” was discovered in the malware code: it turned out that before starting work, the malware accesses the domain iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com, checking whether it exists. If the domain is not registered, the malware begins to encrypt files. However, if the domain exists, the ransomware stops the infection process. As a result, Hutchins registered the specified domain, thereby activating the “kill switch” mechanism, after which the number of successful WannaCry infections decreased sharply, and soon almost disappeared. At present, when all sorts of patches for the exploits with which WannaCry was distributed have long been released, the malware itself has been “neutralized,” and the ransomware is detected by any anti-virus solution, it is extremely difficult to believe that Boeing employees were really attacked by WannaCry.\nDocument [6]: WannaCry: how the largest computer extortion works Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The attackers, whose virus spreads at “hell speed,” collected $12,000 in less than 24 hours The ransomware program blocked tens of thousands of computers around the world on May 12, including government-owned ones institutions and large companies. Russia suffered the most. We answer the main questions about the new threat. What kind of virus is this? WannaCry ransomware (aka WCry and WannaCryptor) encrypts the user's files, making them no longer usable. To decrypt files, the program requires payment in bitcoins, equivalent to 300, according to other sources - 600 dollars. The attackers promise to double the ransom price on May 15 and make changes to the computer irrevocable on May 19. They also promise "free events" for poor users. You can contact the attackers directly through the program. Who has already suffered? Kaspersky Lab has recorded about 45 thousand attempted attacks in 74 countries around the world. The largest number of infection attempts is observed in Russia. Avast employee Jakub Kroustek notes on Twitter that at least 36 thousand computers in the world are infected, most of them in Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. Image copyright Jakub Kroustek Image caption The countries of the former USSR are suffering the most from the virus. In Russia, Sberbank, Megafon and the Ministry of Internal Affairs have already become victims of the virus (previously the department denied infection). In Britain, public hospitals became victims, in Spain - the telecommunications company Telefonica. “The new virus is spreading at a hellish rate,” MalwareHunterTeam researchers report. On Saturday, the Russian Central Bank and Russian Railways reported virus attacks on Russian banks. In both cases, the virus was localized. What does the US National Security Agency have to do with it? For the attack, the hackers used a modified EternalBlue program, originally developed by the US National Security Agency. It was stolen by The Shadow Brokers hackers from Equation Group hackers in August 2016 and published in April 2017. Image caption Judging by the Russian-language version of the program, the terms of the ransom were originally written in a different language and translated by machine. WikiLeaks wrote about the connection between the Equation Group and the US National Security Agency. Kaspersky Lab noted the similarity of Equation Group's tools to Stuxnet, a computer worm that, according to the New York Times, American and Israeli authorities used to attack the Iranian nuclear program. Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden said that the NSA may be indirectly involved in the attack. "NSA's decision to create attack tools against US software now threatens the lives of hospital patients," he tweeted. The NSA has not yet commented on these allegations, while the US Department of Homeland Security has stated that it is aware of the situation with the WannaCry virus and is working to prevent its effects on civilian and government networks. How much has the ransomware "earned" so far? To collect funds, attackers use at least four Bitcoin wallets (1, 2, 3, 4). In less than 24 hours, the victims\nDocument [7]: The No More Ransom project saved victims of cyber ransomware eight million euros A year ago, at the end of July 2016, the No More Ransom website was launched - a joint international initiative of Kaspersky Lab, McAfee, Europol and the Dutch police aimed at combating ransomware Trojans, according to the press. -release. Currently, on the website www.nomoreransom.org you can find 54 file decryption utilities developed by Kaspersky Lab and other project participants. These tools successfully combat 104 ransomware families. Over the course of the year, the No More Ransom website was visited by 1.3 million unique users, of which 150 thousand occurred on May 14 of this year - the peak of the WannaCry ransomware epidemic. The No More Ransom platform is already available in 26 languages. Over the past year, the project has been supported by more than a hundred partners, including both private companies and law enforcement agencies from different countries. “Every day more and more users and organizations are affected by ransomware. In just a few days, more than 300 thousand users in 150 countries around the world, including commercial enterprises and critical infrastructure, became victims of WannaCry infections. The total number of people who have encountered ransomware is also growing: over the past year it has increased by 11% and has already exceeded 2.5 million people. In such conditions, it is very important to fight the threat together, because global problems can only be solved through global efforts,” said Anton Ivanov, antivirus expert at Kaspersky Lab. If you become a victim of malware, experts advise that you should never pay a ransom and be sure to notify the police about the infection.\nDocument [8]: An Accidental Hero explains how he stopped the WannaCry virus Illustration copyright EPA A British cybersecurity researcher told the BBC how he, in what he called "somewhat by accident," stopped the spread of ransomware that locked out tens of thousands of computers around the world on May 12. to the world. The 22-year-old blogger, known online as MalwareTech, made his discovery Friday evening while analyzing the malware code. He noticed that the software was trying to contact an unusual web address - iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com - but this address was not associated with the website because it was not registered with anyone. Whenever the malware tried to communicate with the mysterious website, an error would occur and the virus would go into action, causing damage. As an experiment, MalwareTech decided to spend $10.69 and registered the specified web address. As the owner of a web address, he gained access to analytical data and gained an understanding of the scale of online extortion. But this discovery was not the only one - he soon discovered that after registering the web address, the spread of the malware stopped. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In less than 24 hours, the WannaCry malware infected tens of thousands of computers around the world "It was partly an accident," MalwareTech told the BBC after an all-night investigation during which he says he words, “I didn’t sleep a wink. What happened? At first, the expert suggested that the creator of the malware gave it a command to self-destruct - this is one of the ways to stop the spread of the virus if something suddenly went wrong. In this case, the registration of a mysterious web addresses. But now MalwareTech believes that the malware did not self-destruct, but was “scared” by the so-called virtual machine - a secure platform used, among other things, to detect viruses and read their program code. The real computer cannot access the meaningless address iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea. .com - as opposed to a virtual machine that can pretend to connect to it as if it were a genuine website. Recently, the creators of malware have been embedding a special code into them to check whether the machine they hit is virtual. If yes, then the virus is not activated so as not to be destroyed. “The malware immediately stops running to prevent further analysis,” MalwareTech writes in its blog. “Because of my registration, all these viruses decided that they had entered the virtual machine and logged out of the system. [...] So we unintentionally prevented the spread of ransomware." The researcher who slowed the spread of malware has been called an "accidental hero." "I think that's the right definition," he told the BBC. Is this the end of extortion? While registering a web address appears to have stopped the spread of one strain of the virus, that doesn't mean the source of the ransomware is gone. All files that were encrypted using WannaCry still remain "hostage". Experts also warn about the possible emergence of new, more advanced modifications of WannaCry. "This variant of the virus is unlikely\nDocument [9]: B2B Director of ER-Telecom Holding JSC Elena Ventslavovich - about antiviruses for business B2B Director of ER-Telecom Holding JSC Elena Ventslavovich - about antiviruses for business CHELYABINSK, AN "Access" A month ago, the WannaCryptor (WannaCry) encryption virus lured users around the world have tens of thousands of dollars. He threatened the servers of a number of companies and government agencies. Over three days, more than 200 thousand computers in 150 countries were subjected to a large-scale WannaCry attack. The main blow fell on Russian users and companies. The virus has once again forced businesses to think about information security. Elena Ventslavovich, B2B Director of ER-Telecom Holding JSC (Dom.ru Business brand), talks about how to minimize the risks of infection with malware and viruses, as well as protect yourself from losses in the future. - How can a company face a violation of information security rules? - Business is a constant target of cyber attacks by all kinds of attackers: from hackers hired by unscrupulous competitors to disgruntled employees. Recent history knows many examples when fairly large companies were forced to leave the market after a failure in the information system. Cases of the theft or disclosure of personal information and credit card data of hundreds of millions of customers have become widely known. But in today's computerized world, cybercriminals don't pay attention to the size of companies or the value of data. They are looking for weaknesses and access to money. According to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, in 2016, hackers tried to withdraw more than 1 billion rubles from the accounts of legal entities. The average damage from just one cyber attack for large companies is 11 million rubles, for the small and medium-sized business sector - 1.6 million. Neglect of information security rules entails negative consequences for businesses of any size - loss of important data and confidential information about clients or employees , business process failures, production downtime. The result is damage to business reputation and a decrease in business profitability. - Tell us more about modern information threats. - In modern conditions, business especially needs anti-virus protection. Cyber ​​fraudsters steal passwords to online banking systems, encrypt organizational databases, demanding ransom for file recovery, and spy on behalf of competitors. Business “dependence” on information technology means not only new opportunities, but also vulnerabilities. For example, phishing sites that masquerade as websites of financial or government organizations and seek to steal credentials to access company bank accounts. Millions of spam emails that not only interfere with work, but also carry malware onto employees’ computers. Among the attachments in emails there are often files that exploit known vulnerabilities in office applications. Hacker attacks that can disable a company’s Internet resources (for example, an online store). Separately, it is worth mentioning new types of threats for mobile devices and, first of all, banking Trojans. Bank-client applications for smartphones and tablets are very convenient and are very popular among owners of such devices. This is why they attract numerous criminals seeking to make a profit by any illegal means. - What\nDocument [10]: The "Petya" ransomware triggered a new ransomware epidemic - "Hacker" In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware hit hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. Not only ordinary users, but also numerous companies and organizations suffered from ransomware attacks. The threat was spread using the ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR exploits, essentially exploiting a vulnerability in the SMB protocol and using NSA tools published publicly by the hacker group The Shadow Brokers. The threat of WannaCry was mitigated thanks to the efforts of just one independent information security specialist. An expert known under the pseudonym MalwareTech discovered a kind of emergency switch in the malware’s code: before starting work, the ransomware accessed the iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com domain, checking whether it existed. If the domain was not registered, the malware began to encrypt files. However, if the domain exists, the ransomware stopped the infection process. The researcher rushed to register this domain, which sharply slowed down the spread of WannaCry. It looks like you can’t expect the same luck with the Petya encryptor. Let me remind you that Petya is not a new threat; it was discovered by experts back in early 2016. But today, June 27, 2017, reports of mass Petya infections began to arrive from different countries. Attacks are reported by organizations and users in different countries, including Ukraine, the UK, India, Holland, Spain, Denmark, and so on. The malware operators encrypt victims' files and require them to write an email to wowsmith123456@posteo.net to receive instructions to pay a ransom of $300 in Bitcoin equivalent. Researchers report that the new version of Petya, known as Petya.A, encrypts MFT (Master File Tree) for NTFS partitions, overwrites MBR (Master Boot Record) and has a custom bootloader that displays the ransomware message instead of loading the operating system. According to several sources, the authors of Petya were definitely inspired by the successes of WannaCry, since the ransomware is now distributed via SMB and an exploit very similar to ETERNALBLUE. This information is confirmed by specialists from Payload Security, Avira, Emsisoft, Bitdefender, Symantec and others. In addition, the ransomware also spreads through email spam, hiding inside malicious Office documents and exploiting the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability in Office RTF. Unlike WannaCry, Petya does not have a built-in switch, so it is unlikely that it will be possible to quickly stop the epidemic. Information about new infections appears literally every five minutes, but, apparently, Russia and Ukraine suffered the worst from Petya attacks. Media reports that the ransomware attacked the computer systems of the Cabinet of Ministers and the website of the government of Ukraine, mobile operators Kyivstar, Vodafone and lifecell, Boryspil airport, the metro in Kyiv, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and a number of banks. It is also known that computers of Rosneft, Bashneft, Tatneft and the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works were infected.

The major mining company should fund the decontamination of the local Paraopeba River and the regreening of contaminated areas. However, Jocelino Andreoli, the coordinator of MAB, a group of victims of the dam collapse, specifically pointed out that the victims were absent from this agreement. This makes a mockery of victims’ rights. This agreement is illegal because it is in the name of the victims and the beneficiaries are the current local authorities in Minas Gerais who hope to win re-election through big projects. MAB, a group of victims of the dam collapse, believes that the compensation paid to the victims of the dam collapse is insufficient and announced that it will appeal to the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court.\nDocument [4]: Brazilian mining giant compensates US$6.9 billion for dam collapse in 2019 (Morning News) Brazilian mining giant Vale signed an agreement with the Minas Gerais state government and other relevant departments in Brazil to compensate for the dam collapse that occurred in 2019. For the Madinho dam collapse accident, the company paid approximately US$6.9 billion (approximately S$9.3 billion) in compensation to the local government and communities. Xinhua News Agency reported that Vale issued a communiqué on Thursday (4th) saying that according to the agreement, the company will provide cash compensation to the towns and victims affected by the accident, and fund the local restoration of the damaged environment and promote the construction of livelihood projects. Vale CEO Bartolomeo said: "Vale will fully compensate for the various losses caused by the Brumadinho dam collapse accident, and will be committed to promoting people's livelihood construction in the areas where the company operates." It is reported that Vale Negotiations with the state of Minas Gerais lasted for more than four months, and although the amount of compensation finally reached was lower than the figure originally proposed by the state government, it was still the highest amount paid by a company due to a production accident in the history of Brazil. On January 25, 2019, a Vale mining dam in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais state, collapsed, killing more than 270 people, and 11 people are still missing, making it the most serious safety accident in Brazilian history. one.\nDocument [5]: The collapse of a wastewater dam at an iron ore mine in Brazil killed 272 people, and the operator compensated HK$53.8 billion | Apple Daily A tragedy occurred in Brazil in January last year when a wastewater dam at an iron ore mine collapsed, killing 272 people. The operator of the iron mine, the Brazilian mining giant Vale, ) recently agreed to compensate the state government involved in the accident 37.7 billion reais (53.8 billion Hong Kong dollars), which is believed to be the largest compensation in Latin American history. However, those affected are dissatisfied that they have no role to participate in compensation negotiations, and are even more worried that the compensation will eventually fall into the pockets of irrelevant people. Minas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema announced the news of Vale's agreement to compensate on Thursday, describing it as "the largest compensation package in Latin America." The state government will use the compensation to set up a fund to help revitalize the local economy and improve environmental conditions. The environment that was polluted due to the incident was also used to solve local water supply problems and improve transportation conditions and health services. Some officials said that about 30% of the compensation will be used in Brumadinho, the town where the accident occurred, including compensating those affected, investing in environmental projects and increasing employment opportunities. Regarding the agreement, Zema said excitedly that "we did it" and "we cannot change the past, but we can improve the future." Although there are reports that Minas Gerais originally claimed 54 billion reais, which was higher than the final agreement amount. . Vale CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo said the company is committed to fully repairing and compensating for the damage caused by the tragedy. In addition to causing serious loss of life and the bodies of 11 people have not been found, the incident also flooded an area equivalent to 300 football fields. Some areas were even razed to the ground due to the high-speed dumping of waste. What's more, the waste contained Toxic substances, the Paraopeba River near the site, which is the main water source for irrigation and fishing, is also polluted. Some studies have found that the content of heavy metals in the local environment exceeds legal standards, and the levels of iron, copper, manganese and other elements are enough to cause cancer. In addition, many family members of the deceased also committed suicide afterwards. Three civil society groups representing the bereaved family and affected residents said they were dissatisfied with the compensation agreement because the negotiations were not transparent and the affected people had no role to participate. The group also pointed out that Vale later paid monthly living allowances, temporary housing and psychological treatment expenses for about 106,000 people, but did not inform them how much compensation they would receive in the future, and the compensation stipulated in the agreement already included the amount previously paid by Vale. Zema stressed, however, that the compensation agreement would not affect criminal or civil claims in the matter. 16 people who were senior executives\nDocument [6]: Mine collapse in Brazil increases to at least 40 deaths, and chances of survivors are slim | Hong Kong 01 | The world said that a mine collapsed in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (Minas Gerais) last Friday (25th) local time, and the death toll The number has increased to at least 40, and about 300 people are still missing. Rescuers took a helicopter to inspect the area in mid-air and began to dig out the mud. It is believed that more bodies will be found later. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited the disaster area last Saturday (26th) and described the accident as a "tragedy." Rescue workers temporarily closed their teams after nightfall last Saturday and expected to resume search and rescue efforts early Sunday morning. However, it rained from time to time, making the search and rescue work more difficult. Governor Romeu Zema told local media that the chances of finding survivors at this stage are slim, and it is likely that only the remains of the victims will be found, and he promised to punish those responsible for the incident. He continued that the company involved, Vale Minerals (Vale), had obtained permission from the authorities for its operations, and the mine that caused the accident had been idle for many years. The cause of the accident is currently unknown. The state court issued an order on Saturday to freeze the assets of Vale Minerals Company of 5 billion Brazilian reals (approximately 10.4 billion Hong Kong dollars) to compensate for the losses caused by the accident. After the mine collapsed last Friday afternoon, about 1 million cubic meters of mud containing iron ore waste flowed out, severely damaging the administrative area of ​​the mine and nearby mountain villages. (AP/Reuters)\nDocument [7]: Vale's iron ore sales contract declares "force majeure" Foreign media reported that Brazilian mining giant Vale announced that due to the suspension of production at its Brucutu mine, the group declared "force majeure" on a series of iron ore contracts. According to the force majeure clause, if the contract cannot be performed due to reasons beyond its control, the parties can be exempted from liability. The company said last week it would not declare force majeure on its iron ore contracts. It is reported that the Brazilian court has frozen 6 billion reais (about 12.8 billion Hong Kong dollars) of Vale's funds for compensation; in addition, the company faces 250 million reais (more than 500 million Hong Kong dollars) and 99 million reais respectively from the government environmental protection department. Yare (nearly HK$200 million) fine. Last month, a tailings dam of Vale in Minas Gerais, Brazil, collapsed, killing more than 130 people. A Brazilian court recently ruled that its Brucutu mine should suspend some operations to strengthen production safety. Vale said the move would result in a loss of 30 million tons of annual iron ore production. The company has previously announced that it will cut production by 40 million tons, which has caused iron ore prices to rise sharply. Since the tailings dam collapse on January 25, Singapore iron ore futures have risen by more than US$10 per ton. Analysts reported that given that this is the second time a similar accident has occurred in Vale in three years, it is expected to face stricter compensation and harsher penalty requirements; and it is expected that iron ore prices will rise further. ArcelorMittal, Glencore and Ternium are Vale's largest customers. ------ "Sic Bo House" sincerely invites [Gambling Kings] and [Queens of Gambling] from all over the world to challenge the realm of gods and humans, with millions of chips waiting for you to collect every day!

German engineer arrested after dam collapse in Brazil (Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The police raided the office of TÜV Rheinland Group Süd in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and confiscated computers and documents. According to media reports, the quality inspection certification issued by TÜV Süd was the basis for issuing an operating license for the dam in December last year. However, this important certification document also mentioned possible risks to the dam. It is said that a representative of the Brazilian government's environmental agency (Ibama) opposed the issuance of the certification. A representative of the company told the dpa reporter: "Now we can confirm that two employees of the TÜV Süd branch have been arrested in Brazil." They are responsible for the final approval process of the dam's quality inspection and are now detained in Mina "Due to the ongoing investigation, we are unable to provide further information." A company representative said. We fully support the investigation. " Extended reading: The number of victims of Brazil's mining dam disaster rises to 58. Distribution of emergency aid. In addition, Brazilian police also detained three employees of the mining company Vale. The mining group said that the company is currently cooperating with relevant departments. Investigation work. The company said: "In order to clarify the facts as soon as possible, Vale will continue to support the investigation work. "The company will pay 23,000 euros in emergency aid to each affected family. On Monday, the company's market value on the Sao Paulo stock exchange evaporated 16.5 billion euros, more than 24% of the value of its shares. Investigators currently have 30 days Time to hear the statements of the five detained engineers. According to sources from the prosecutor, "Vale may be held criminally responsible." Firefighters search for the bodies of the victims in the Corrego do Feijao mining area in Brumadinho. Last Friday, the dam at the Córrego do Feijão iron ore mine collapsed, causing serious damage to some of the mine facilities and adjacent residential areas. The death toll confirmed by the Brazilian Civil Defense has risen to 84. More than 250 people are still missing. Therefore, the death toll is likely to rise. A spokesman for the fire department said: "Unfortunately, the possibility of finding survivors is very slim." "The accidental dam built in 1976 was 86 meters high. It had been decommissioned before the collapse and was planned to be demolished. Brazil's Vale Mining Company, which owns the dam, emphasized that the German TÜV Rheinland Group Süd Branch inspected the dam last September. An inspection was conducted, but no problems were found in the dam. When the dam was inspected again in January, no defects were found. Li Jinghui/Ye Xuan (AFP, Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Catholic News Agency)\nDocument [9]: Vale's dam burst accident expanded, and China's iron ore futures once hit the daily limit. On January 25, the dam burst accident at Mine No. 1 of Vale's Feijão mining area in the Brumadinho region of Brazil gradually expanded its impact and exceeded the market's original expectations. According to the latest news, the number of victims in this accident has risen to 58, and more than 300 people are missing. The product affected by this accident is Vale's southern system Brazil crude product, which is the raw material for the Brazilian Blend Blend (BRBF) that Vale has promoted to the Chinese market. In the short term, because Vale has sufficient ore stocks in Chinese ports and Malaysian ports, the supply can be guaranteed. In addition, the output of the mining area itself accounts for about 2.1% of Vale's overall output. The proportion is not high, and it will have little impact on the short-term supply of the market. However, the market is worried that the accident will cause a huge number of casualties and Vale will face huge fines. Currently, the Brazilian government has frozen approximately RMB 10.7 billion of Vale's funds for future compensation matters and fined Vale RMB 630 million. . In the future, large-scale inspections and maintenance may be carried out in the mining areas in southern Brazil. These factors may have a medium- and long-term supply impact on the mining areas and even the entire iron ore market. Chart: Oriental Fortune Network, Dalian iron ore futures daily commodity market, on the 28th, the main iron ore contract of Dalian Commodity Exchange once reached the daily limit in early trading, and finally closed at 550.5 yuan / ton, an increase of 2.8%, a record of nearly 20 Monthly high. As of 11:30 noon on the 29th, iron ore prices are still fluctuating and rising, with an increase of 0.72%. According to market participants, Chinese steel mills are currently not carrying out large-scale replenishment. The downstream response to the embankment breach accident is relatively calm, but traders are more active and continue to inquire for prices. Wang Guoqing, director of the Lange Steel Research Center, said that the accident will make the market expect a decline in output, and iron ore prices may have some room for growth in the short term. Considering that the current iron ore market is still in a state of oversupply, this upward trend should not last too long. In the medium term, we need to observe the evolution of the overall subsequent accident. According to the case of Vale's Sarmaco accident in 2015, the subsequent impact of this accident does not rule out the possibility of expansion.\nDocument [10]: The number of victims of Brazil's mine dam disaster rises to 58 (Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the dam in Brumaginho broke last Friday, 58 people have been killed so far, and hundreds more are missing. While conducting search and rescue operations on January 27, the mining company heard a water level alarm coming from the B6 Dam. The B6 dam is another dam in the same area as the collapsed dam. This caused the search and rescue team to interrupt the search and rescue operation and instead evacuate the people. About 39,000 people were notified to seek refuge in higher ground. But that afternoon, officials said there was no risk of the dam failing. On January 25, a dam at an iron ore plant in southeastern Brazil burst at noon local time, spreading a large amount of sludge and slag in the Brumadinho area of ​​Minas Gerais. The dam stores waste from mineral manufacturing and contains the equivalent of 1 million cubic meters of water. About 300 people are missing, including 100 employees of the mining company Vale. Vale Minerals (Vale), the world's leading iron ore company, also experienced a dam burst at the same location in 2015. At that time, 19 people died, and millions of tons of toxic substances were spread across the earth. After Friday's accident, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency has initially fined the mining company $66.5 million and frozen the company's assets of about $3 billion.

How the USSR managed to overtake the Europeans in this race, Gazeta.Ru recalls. The past year was rich in fiftieth anniversaries. 1968 was a year of many political events, as well as achievements that largely determined the further development of science and technology. The death of Gagarin, the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy in the United States, the entry of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia, the Brezhnev doctrine, the first flight of the Moon by the Soviet satellite Zond-5, the first flight of the Soviet Tu-154 airliner - the half-century anniversary of all these events were celebrated in the past year. However, on the last day of 1968, another significant event took place in the USSR, which was directly related to the rivalry between the USSR and Western countries - on this day the Soviet Union won the race for civilian supersonics. In the 50s, Soviet engineers had already achieved considerable success in creating supersonic combat aircraft, including the heavy class. However, to design and create from scratch the first passenger airliner capable of flying faster than sound meant technically entering a previously unexplored area where there are no ready-made answers and proven solutions. If all the first supersonic combat vehicles in the world were designed for short-term supersonic flight, then the Soviet Tu-144 had to cruise at speeds at least exceeding two speeds of sound. The plane was supposed to fly at a cruising speed of 2300-2700 km/h, and have a practical supersonic flight range of 4000-4500 km with 80-100 passengers. It was the first aircraft completely designed by Alexei Tupolev, the son of the eminent designer Andrei Tupolev. A characteristic feature of the Tu-144 was the bow of the fuselage that lowered in front of the pilot's cabin, which provided visibility at high angles of attack during takeoff and landing. This technical solution alone invalidates the assertion that the Soviet Tu-144 was “written off” from the European supersonic competitor, the Concorde airliner, the creators of which literally breathed down the backs of Soviet designers. Another know-how was the introduction of a stabilizer wing that was retractable in flight, extending from the front of the fuselage during takeoff and landing modes. The plane was assembled in great haste; the authorities of the country and the designer could not allow a non-Soviet-made supersonic passenger plane to take off first. Earlier, Gazeta.Ru told how a year before the first flight, ice on the rivers almost disrupted the rhythmic process of assembling the aircraft. Then, in the winter of 1967, a uniquely complex delivery of the wings of the first aircraft from Voronezh to Zhukovsky near Moscow was carried out using a Mi-10 helicopter crane. As a result, the first prototype with tail number USSR-68001\nDocument [2]: Who will win the battle for supersonic passenger spacecraft? Us or the West: who will win the battle for supersonic passenger flights 50 years ago (1969), the first flight of the Anglo-French supersonic passenger airliner Concorde took place. For a variety of reasons, including very dramatic ones, on November 26, 2003, supersonic airliner flights were ended. It seemed that the era of supersonic in civil aviation had come to an end. However, not so long ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced its revival, pointing out the need to create a domestic supersonic passenger aircraft. “We now need to return to ultra-high-speed, supersonic passenger traffic.” We need to think about this, he emphasized. Before the president had time to say this, literally two hours after his speech, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) announced that it was already working on a supersonic airliner project, which could use technologies used in the Tu-160 strategic missile carrier. Nobody knows whether the UAC will be able to implement this statement or not. However, in order to understand what difficulties will stand in the way of the construction of such a liner, we must turn to history. How it all began The beginning of work on the creation of supersonic passenger airliners dates back to the late 1950s; this task began to be considered by aircraft manufacturers almost immediately after breaking the sound barrier and the appearance of supersonic bombers. The most intensive research took place in the USA and the USSR, as well as in Great Britain and France. Scientific research has shown that the best aerodynamic quality at the selected cruising speed and size of the aircraft is ensured by the use of a “tailless” design with a delta wing. To ensure efficiency over a wide range of speeds, the wing was given a complex shape with a sweep angle varying along the span. Engineers from the Soviet Union, the USA and Europe followed this path. European agreement "Concord" On November 5, 1956, in the UK, the Ministry of Supply created the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee (STAC), which united 9 of the country's largest aviation organizations to continue the successful implementation of jet commercial aviation in the country and select a supersonic aircraft project. In 1960, the committee's work was based on the project of the company's record-breaking prototype fighter Fairey Delta 2, successfully tested since 1954, which for the first time introduced the common features of supersonic passenger aircraft: tailless with a low aspect ratio wing, with a complex leading edge, single-tail tail, high landing gear and a lowered front part fuselage for viewing during landing with a high angle of attack. This stage ended with the selection of the Bristol type 223 design proposal and the search for partners for the development of such a large commercial enterprise. A little later, similar work began in France - the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle project. In 1962, the British and French governments joined forces to create and produce the aircraft. This is how the project of the supersonic passenger aircraft “Concorde” was created. A total of 20\nDocument [3]: “To another continent twice as fast”: how the development of the Russian supersonic business jet is progressing. A model of the Russian supersonic business jet was presented at the MAKS-2019 aerospace salon in Zhukovsky. Its developer is the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute. In a conversation with RT, a representative of the enterprise said that scientists have already conducted several important experiments that will make it possible to produce a durable glider and wings. The business jet will be able to carry up to eight people at a speed of Mach 1.8. The aircraft, analysts believe, will be in demand in the domestic and foreign markets. The Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) presented a prototype of a supersonic business aircraft at the MAKS-2019 International Aviation and Space Salon. The company has already conducted a series of studies and experiments, having decided on the aerodynamic design of the aircraft. As Danil Fomin, the leading engineer of TsAGI of the Strength complex, said in an interview with RT, the length of the aircraft will be 38 m, the speed will be Mach 1.8 (about 1.9 thousand km/h), the flight range will be 6-8 thousand km. According to him, as part of the project, an unmanned demonstrator can be manufactured to test the effects of sonic boom damping. However, Fomin emphasized that the final decision on its construction has not yet been made. “Research at TsAGI has been carried out for more than one year. Supersonic passenger transportation is a very expensive subject. For a very long time, such pleasure will be available to a limited circle of people. That's why we offer a business jet option. The aircraft will be able to fly across the Atlantic or to another continent twice as fast as subsonic aircraft,” Fomin said. “The future of supersonic aviation lies in business jets” For more than 15 years, humanity has been deprived of the opportunity to fly supersonic. In November 2003, the last flight of the Concord airliner took place, reaching a speed of about Mach 2 (over 2 thousand km/h). It was decided to abandon this unique aircraft due to a wave of negativity in the media after a single disaster, as well as due to excessively high ticket prices (about $5 thousand) and maintenance costs. The accident occurred on July 25, 2000 at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. The plane of the British company British Aircraft and the French company Sud Aviation caught fire while climbing. The crash killed 113 people. Also on the topic Based on military technologies: what are the prospects for Russian supersonic civil aviation, Vladimir Putin, during his visit to Tatarstan, proposed returning to the idea of ​​​​producing a domestic supersonic civil aircraft.... A chain of tragic accidents led to the disaster: during acceleration, the Concord chassis ran over a metal part , which was not removed from the runway. A piece of rubber torn off from one of the wheels pierced the fuel tank, and the fuel instantly fell on the flames of the running engines. Previously, due to the high cost of tickets and several\nDocument [4]: In Russia, the Tu-144 was criticized and a “windowless” plane was invented - Rambler/news In Russia, the Tu-144 was criticized and a “windowless” plane was invented. The “crane nose” that lowered during landing to improve the pilots’ view was the “calling card” of the Soviet Tu-144 , however, it made the structure of this supersonic passenger aircraft heavier, Sergei Chernyshev, scientific director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), told RIA Novosti. According to him, the weight of the aircraft was increased by hydraulic drives, with the help of which the nose of the Tu-144 was controlled. As the agency writes, instead, it is possible to make a plane with “a solid fuselage without windows; there won’t even be any in the cockpit.” “There are LCD screens on the sides and ceiling of the cabin. Passengers see what is happening overboard thanks to the digital vision of the aircraft and feel comfortable. Pilots use instruments that are now much more advanced than human senses. The body pipe without cutouts is more durable, due to this we will reduce the wall thickness and reduce the weight of the structure,” said the specialist. According to the project, prepared with the participation of Chernyshev, it is proposed to equip the Russian supersonic aircraft with a wing “in the form of a double transverse V”, and not with a highly swept delta wing, like the Tu-144. According to the scientific director of TsAGI, the need for pilots may disappear in the aircraft of the future. The engine of the Russian supersonic aircraft is proposed to be created on the basis of the PD-14. In October 2000, the German Aviation Museum (Munich) bought one of the Tu-144s, the world's first supersonic passenger airliners, for half a million dollars.\nDocument [5]: Russian President Vladimir Putin, watching the first flight of the new Tu-160 bomber in Kazan, invited aircraft manufacturers to think about creating a supersonic passenger aircraft. The iz.ru portal recalls the history of such aircraft, which were already in operation in the USSR, France and Great Britain. “The future belongs to aviation, to combat aviation, in order to ensure the country’s defense capability, and to civil aviation too. But we, as we have just discussed, need to think about the civilian version of such aircraft. With such a huge territory as ours, the flight from Moscow to New York is not much longer than to Vladivostok. Therefore, I am sure that this will be in demand,” said the head of state, commenting on the resumption of serial production of the Tu-160 bomber at the Kazan aircraft plant. The first thing to note is that discussing the proposed proposal straightforwardly, in the option of creating a supersonic passenger aircraft directly on the basis of a multi-mode missile-carrying bomber with variable wing geometry, is a rather difficult task. This is not only an expensive solution due to the complexity of the design that is unreasonable in civil aviation. The cruising speed of the Tu-160 is subsonic - 850 km/h, which, by the way, is 30–60 km/h lower than that of conventional modern wide-body aircraft, which calls into question even such a narrow hypothetical niche as a business jet for billionaires. Let us also recall that the cruising speed of both supersonic aircraft that were in commercial operation (Tu-144 and Concorde) exceeded Mach 2 and was about 2200 km/h. supersonic_1 Modernized strategic missile carrier Tu-160M ​​“Peter Deinekin” during a demonstration flight Photo: TASS/Lystseva Marina “Of course, we are not talking about creating an aircraft based on the Tu-160. Currently, several projects of supersonic business jets are being developed in the world, some of them were studied with the participation of Russian research centers,” Vedomosti quotes a top manager of one of the aviation industry enterprises in this regard. The issue of resuming the program of a fundamentally new supersonic passenger aircraft is an independent complex topic for discussion by specialists in the design and operation of aircraft. In the event that a sufficiently capacious market niche is found for the aircraft, which covers the costs of its creation and maintenance costs, the issue will move to the second stage, namely, the search in Russia for a design team capable of solving the problem. At the moment, the country is implementing two programs of fundamentally new aircraft (Superjet and MC-21), and the industry is also integrating into the Chinese CR929 wide-body airliner project. In fact, they are all built around Sukhoi Civil Aircraft and Irkut (Engineering Center named after A.S. Yakovlev), which, as part of the proposed model for reforming the United Aircraft Corporation, will be merged into a centralized company dealing with commercial aircraft. In the meantime, let's try to remember how the fate of previous supersonic airliners turned out. First-second The design of supersonic passenger aircraft in the world began in the late 1950s.\nDocument [6]: From 2012, Russia will limit the operation of Tu-134, An-24 and Yak-40 Moscow aircraft. Since 2012, the operation of Tu-134, An-24 and Yak-40 aircraft has been limited in the Russian Federation. As UNIAN was told by the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, this was discussed at a meeting at which issues related to the implementation of the instructions of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to remove Tu-134 aircraft from service on regular flights were discussed. “At the meeting it was emphasized that the requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations, according to which, from January 1, 2012, the operation of aircraft with gas turbine engines whose mass exceeds 5,700 kg, or on board which is allowed to carry more than 9 people, will be prohibited. (Tu-134, An-24, Yak-40, etc.), not equipped with a ground proximity warning system that has the function of assessing the terrain in the direction of flight, will come into effect within the specified period,” the message says. In this regard, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation instructed the Federal Air Transport Agency to send a directive to airlines to stop selling tickets for flights operated on specified aircraft that are not equipped with such a system. It was also noted at the meeting that currently the total fleet of Tu-134 aircraft in Russia is 179 aircraft, of which only 90 aircraft are operated, including 28 by UTair-Express. The Russian Ministry of Transport, together with the Federal Air Transport Agency, is working on a schedule for removing Tu-134 aircraft from service on regular flights. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to send an appeal to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia and the Tupolev Design Bureau with a proposal to terminate the procedures for increasing resources and extending the service life of Tu-134 aircraft operating on regular airlines. As UNIAN reported, on Thursday, June 23, Russian President D. MEDVEDEV instructed the Ministry of Transport to analyze the issue of decommissioning the Tu-134 from regular flights starting next year. At the same time, he emphasized that this decision was not caused by the plane crash in Karelia. Let us remind you that late in the evening of June 20, a Tu-134 plane flying along the Domodedovo-Petrozavodsk route crashed during landing. 45 people were killed, 7 were injured. Among the dead are two citizens of Ukraine.\nDocument [7]: Passenger supersonic. What was the difference between the Concorde and the Tu-144 Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Concorde made its first flight with the landing gear extended Exactly half a century ago, on March 2, 1969 at 15:40:11 at the airfield in Toulouse at the very beginning of the supersonic runway The Concorde passenger plane, which had warmed up its engines by that time, brought them to full power and took off. He had run along this strip several times before, but now he was about to take to the air for the first time. The plane with serial number 001 ran past the podium with guests and journalists, and when the wheels of its landing gear left the runway, there was friendly applause on it. However, they were barely audible - the air was filled with the roar of four jet engines. The first flight lasted 27 minutes at a relatively low speed of 500 kilometers per hour, with the landing gear extended. A month after this flight, the airliner Concorde 002 made its first flight in the UK. And two months before the first takeoff of the Concorde, the first flight of the Tu-144, an aircraft that was similar in appearance to the Concorde, took place at the airfield at the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky near Moscow. like a twin brother. Due to its external similarity, the Soviet aircraft soon received the nickname “Concorde” in the West. Image copyright Polikashin/TASS Image caption Tu-144 before its first flight These flights marked the end of a race that could well be compared to a “space” race - Europe, represented by Great Britain and France, competed with the Soviet Union for the right to be considered the first to create a supersonic passenger plane. However, having overtaken its rivals at the start, the USSR was never able to build an aircraft that would achieve the declared parameters in terms of range and, most importantly, efficiency. As a result, having flown on the Moscow-Alma-Ata route for only a few months, the Tu-144 retired from the race. And Concorde, which was two months behind it, served until 2003. Great political race The idea of ​​​​building such an aircraft appeared immediately after the military learned to overcome the speed of sound. However, in order to create a supersonic passenger aircraft, it was necessary to create many new technological solutions - it was so different from military projects. It's not just a matter of safety - a bomber, for example, does not fly at supersonic speed all the time, it accelerates only during certain stages of the flight, while a passenger plane must fly at this speed most of the time it is in the air. For this he needed new engines. When the USSR joined the supersonic race, then, of course, not only research institutes, but also intelligence services became the source of new technologies. This competition was not so much economic as political. However, there is no direct evidence that the USSR could copy the Concorde. “Let’s just say that tasks were\nDocument [8]: Russian Defense Ministry plane crash on the way to Syria on December 26, 2016. Press review | InoPressa: topic of the day Russian Defense Ministry plane crash on the way to Syria The plane crash killed 92 people, including choir members of the famous Alexandrov ensemble, flying to the Khmeimim base, from where most Russian air raids in support of Assad take place. The tragedy with the Tu-154, willy-nilly, makes Russians think about their country’s military campaign in Syria, the media write. Famous philanthropist Elizaveta Glinka was also on board. “On Sunday, a Russian military plane flying to Syria crashed and fell into the Black Sea,” writes The Financial Times correspondent Katrin Hille, referring to a Russian Defense Ministry passenger plane. Among the passengers were choristers of the famous Alexandrov ensemble, who were scheduled to perform at the Khmeimim airbase. “From this base, Russia launched most of the airstrikes that ultimately helped turn the tide of the Syrian civil war in favor of President Assad,” the article says. “The disaster occurred just a few days after a gunman who mentioned the Syrian city of Aleppo shot and killed Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov in Ankara. It could once again draw attention to Moscow’s military campaign in Syria, a topic that has not yet become the main focus of Russian public opinion. opinions,” writes the journalist. Russian media reported that investigators were focusing on a technical fault as a potential cause of the disaster. “The plane, which was delivering a famous military band to Syria to perform for Russian troops there, crashed into the Black Sea shortly after takeoff,” writes The New York Times. The Russian-built Tu-154 military aircraft disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from Sochi. The weather service said conditions at the airport were "normal, calm." The aircraft met all technical requirements, the Ministry of Defense said. Among the passengers were three journalists from Channel One, as well as journalists from the Zvezda and NTV TV channels. Elizaveta Glinka, a prominent Russian philanthropist and member of the Presidential Council for Human Rights and Civil Society, was also on the passenger list, the newspaper notes. “The age and reputation of the Tu-154, as well as the fact that the plane took off from a military airfield with increased security measures, allowed most senior officials who spoke publicly to rule out the possibility of a terrorist attack. But some aviation experts suggest - and following them, some officials “that terrorism cannot be ruled out, given the suddenness with which the plane disappeared and the radius of the crash area,” the publication writes. “For us, the worst version is a terrorist attack, because if this is so, it will mean that we paid for Aleppo again,” said aviation expert Vadim Lukashevich. The Islamic State (banned in the Russian Federation - editor's note) announced its involvement in the crash in October 2015 of a civilian airbus flying from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, the publication recalls. “The second national tragedy in less than a week” is what The Washington Post\nDocument [9]: Supersonic flight to civilian life On January 25, testing of the unique supersonic strategic missile carrier Tu-160M2 began. Its first flight was personally observed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The M2 is not just a modernized car. In fact, this bomber was built from scratch. The Strategist received modern navigation equipment, an aiming system and on-board avionics. In the future, its arsenal will include the latest missiles, including hypersonic ones. The Russian leader praised the aircraft and invited aircraft manufacturers to make a civilian version of it. Return of "Peter Deinekin" The first flight of the Tu-160M2, which received its own name "Peter Deinekin", lasted about seven minutes. At an altitude of 300 m, the crew of the missile carrier performed several maneuvers to test the stability and controllability of the vehicle in the air. “This is a serious step in the development of the high-tech sector and in strengthening the country’s defense capability, because this is one of the elements of our nuclear triad in the air,” Vladimir Putin emphasized in a conversation with employees of the Kazan Aviation Plant named after Gorbunov. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the start of construction of the updated Tu-160M2 strategic bombers back in 2015. The Pyotr Deinekin was rolled out of the hangar on November 16 last year. This vehicle was completed using the stock of hulls and engines left over from Soviet times. As Izvestia was told by the United Aircraft Corporation, deep modernization will increase the combat effectiveness of the Tu-160 by more than 60% by expanding functions and improving the characteristics of on-board equipment, as well as increasing the accuracy of navigation systems, using new self-defense and countermeasures. A new information and control system will be installed on the Tu-160M2, the main advantage of which is the collection, processing and output of flight information in a single system. The missile carrier will also be able to use new types of weapons. According to Izvestia, tests of the latest aviation weapons for the Tu-160M2 are already underway. The vehicle, in particular, will receive strategic cruise missiles with an increased flight range. And in the future, its arsenal will also include hypersonic weapons: missiles flying at a speed of about 7.5 thousand km/h. Supersonic for citizens and business After the completion of the first test flight, Vladimir Putin made an unexpected offer to Russian aircraft manufacturers. Create a civil aircraft based on the Tu-160. Previously, the Soviet Union had already produced Tu-144 supersonic passenger airliners. But after about 100 flights, these machines were removed from service. “Why did the Tu-144 go out of production? The ticket should have corresponded to some average earnings in the country,” the president noted. - But now the situation is different. Now large companies have appeared that could use this aircraft. The head of state noted that such a machine would be in demand given the size of Russia’s territory: from Moscow, according to him, it would not take much longer to fly to New York than to Vladivostok. The United Aircraft Corporation told Izvestia that they\nDocument [10]: Polish airline LOT has resumed flights to Montenegro History of the issue Air transportation refers to the transportation of passengers and the transportation of goods by air. Although the first passenger aircraft were built before the First World War, it was only in the 1930s that flights became a more or less widespread phenomenon. In the 50-60s, old piston aircraft actively began to displace jet aircraft, due to which the average flight speed began to increase sharply. This trend reached its peak in the late 60s, when supersonic passenger aircraft Tu-144 and Concorde were created. However, due to poor efficiency and noise, they were withdrawn from service without replacement, and airlines focused on reducing costs. Regional and regional air transportation in Russia is a separate and sensitive topic. The previously developed small aviation in the USSR actually ceased to exist with the collapse of the Union. Since the 2000s, attempts have been made to revive it. Despite this, as well as statements by officials about the vital need for light passenger and cargo aircraft due to the lack of roads in most of Siberia and the Far East, small aviation often remains the only mode of transport in these areas.\n\nReport:
